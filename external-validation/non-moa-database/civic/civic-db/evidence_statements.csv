822,"The T allele of the rs16906252 SNP was associated with MGMT methylation and low protein expression. Germline presence of the T allele increased the risk of glioblastoma development (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; P = .013). Temozolomide treatment led to better survival in patients with the rs16906252 T genotype irrespective of methylation status."
823,"TFF3 expression was assessed by IHC in 75 patients, 187 patients were identified for the validation cohort. TFF3 expression was associated with response to endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide or oophorectomy) and outperformed ER, PR and TFF1 as biomarkers."

842,"Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression under sequential crizotinib, ceritinib, HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 and chemotherapy followed by crizotinib again. Third generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib led to a partial response that lasted for 8 months. The C1156Y mutation was confirmed in a sample prior to initial crizotinib (<7% of cells), following crizotinib treatment (~50% of cells) and following lorlatinib resistance (100% of cells). However, a second ALK mutation (C1156Y & L1198F) was detected in the lorlatinib resistant tumor."
844,"Case report of a patient with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC. After developing resistance to first and second line ALK inhibitors mediated by a C1156Y mutation, the patient had a partial response with the third generation ALK-inhibitor lorlatinib.

851,"In this preclinical study, MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors with mutant TP53 showed a better clinical response to chemotherapy (doxorubicin) than TP53 wild-type tumors. This was mediated by wild-type TP53-induced cell-arrest under chemotherapy even in the context of heterozygous TP53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus the status of both TP53 alleles should be assessed because even one copy of wild-type TP53 may contribute to poor response to chemotherapy."

FOXP3 expression was found in 405 tumor samples and associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles of 'FEC100' aka epirubicin + cyclophosphamide + 5-fluorouracil) but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline->taxane (3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased."

935,"In this screen of 218 solid cancer cell lines, KRAS and BRAF mutations were predictive of response to MEK inhibitor GSK1120212. 40 cell lines harbored a KRAS mutation. In RAF/RAS mutant colon cancer cell lines, co-occurring PIK3CA/PTEN mutations led to a cytostatic (9/10 cell lines) response rather than a cytotoxic response (1/10 cell lines)."
936,"In this screen of 218 solid cancer cell lines, BRAF mutations were predictive of response to the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212. 26 of these cell lines had the BRAF V600E mutation, one cell line had a G469A mutation, one had G596R mutation and one had an unspecified mutation. Also of note, in RAF/RAS mutant colon cancer cell lines, co-occurring PIK3CA/PTEN mutations led to a cytostatic response rather than a cytotoxic response."

In total, 20 (1689 patients, 594 with increased gene copy number), 10 (822 patients, 290 with increased gene copy number) and 5 studies (294 patients, 129 with increased gene copy number) were analyzed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-progression (TTP) meta-analyses respectively. EGFR amplification was associated with increased OS (HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.89; P = 0.001), PFS (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.46-0.79; P<0.001) and TTP (HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.28-0.91; P = 0.02). This effect was shown to influence survival in predominantly white patient populations but not patients of Asian descent."
954,"82 patients treated with gefitinib were retrospectively analyzed for EGFR mRNA expression (rt-PCR in 64 patients). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (>5.01) had 43% response probability, whereas patients with low EGFR mRNA expression had 8% response probability (P = 0.006). PFS but not OS was also longer in patients with high EGFR mRNA expression."

Three patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified (Y772_A775dup, G776L, and G778_P780dup). Objective response was observed in all three of these patients."
960,"In preclinical studies of transgenic mice and xenografts, continuous expression of mutant ERBB2 (M774insAYVM or the equivalent A775insYVMA) was found to be essential for tumor maintenance. Furthermore, preclinical in vivo studies assessing erlotinib, trastuzumab, afatinib (aka BIBW2992), and/or sirolimus (aka rapamycin) revealed that the combination of afatinib and sirolimus was most effective in shrinking tumors harboring this insertion."
961,"A phase II study involving adult female patients, >=18 years, with stage IIIB or IV HER2-positive (by IHC and/or in situ fluorescence) metastatic breast cancer. All patients were previously treated with trastuzumab and a median of three chemotherapy lines. 41 patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression and the primary endpoint was objective response rate. 4 patients (10% of 41 treated; 11% of evaluable patients) had partial response and 15 patients (37% of 41) had stable disease as best response. Thus a total of 19 (46% of 41) achieved clinical benefit. Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks."
962,"Afatinib was growth-inhibitory for three pancreatic cancer cell lines but cytotoxic only toward BxPC3 (KRAS wt) and Capan-2 (KRAS mut) cells, both of which express high levels of EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 receptors. Afatinib increased the radiosensitivity of BxPC3 and Capan-2 cells. In comparison, Panc-1 cells (KRAS mut) expressing low levels of EGFR family receptors were resistant to afatinib-induced radiosensitization."
963,"Cell line, xenograft, and transgenic models were used to establish Osimertinib as an inhibitor of both EGFR mutation sensitizing (L858M, del exon 19) and T790M resistance mutants. Preclinically, the drug inhibits signaling pathways and cellular growth in both EGFRm(+) and EGFRm(+)/T790M(+) mutant cell lines in vitro, with lower activity against wild-type EGFR lines. Sustained tumor regression was observed in EGFR-mutant tumor xenograft and transgenic models. Treatment of 2 patients with advanced EGFRm(+) T790M(+) NSCLC was reported as proof of principle."

In contrast, among 61 patients without EGFR T790M, the response rate was 21% (95% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months in EGFR T790M-negative patients."
966,"This study summarized 9 EGFR-mutant patients from two clinical trials involving rociletinib (NCT01526928) and subsequent osimertinib (NCT01802632). 8 were T790M-positive prior to treatment with osimertinib. 6 transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib. 3 patients achieved PR and 4 achieved SD. The median PFS was 208 days (95% CI, 41-208 days). Among 6 patients who transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib all derived clinical benefit from osimertinib with either prolonged SD or PR."
967,"For cell harboring EGFR T790M mutation, osimertinib and rociletinib showed potent inhibition compared to erlotinib or afatinib. This study performed drug response assays using five human NSCLC cell lines with various combinations of EGFR mutations.

972,"Serum and tissue levels of HER2 (ERBB2) were analyzed in 1,902 breast cancer patients treated with lapatinib or control. Serum HER2 (sHER2) levels measured by ELISA were higher in patients with HER2 amplification (median sHER2 levels were 25.1 ng/mL in patients with HER2-positive tumors). Serum HER2 levels were Independent predictors of lapatinib progression free survival benefit (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in serum HER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.009 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.044; P interaction < .001). Tissue HER2 levels were also predictive, but within this subgroup, serum HER2 still independently predicted lapatinib PFS benefit."

This effect was observed in the EGFR exon 19 deletion subgroup, but not in the L858R mutant subgroup."
985,"Melanoma patients treated with Anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, MPDL3280A) therapy were analyzed for expression of HLA-DRA (the primary antigen-presenting molecule of the MHC-II pathway). In a discovery cohort, 30 patients underwent IHC for HLA-DRA. 11/14 (79%) patients with positive HLA-DR staining, had complete (n=3) or partial (n=8) response. 6/16 (38%) HLA-DR non-expressing melanomas responded to therapy (overall response rate 79 versus 38%, Fisher’s exact test P=0.033). This finding was confirmed in a second independent data set of 23 melanoma patients with 6/8 (75%) of HLA-DR(+) tumours in comparison to 4/15 (27%) HLA-DR(−) responding (Fisher’s exact test P=0.025). Preclinical models confirmed the result."

1002,"In-vitro study in 5 neuroblastoma cell lines (2 with NRAS Q61K mutation). The combination of mTOR and MEK Inhibitors synergistically blocked cell growth in NRAS mutant but not wild type cell lines. Single agent MEK inhibition (AZD6244/selumetinib, MEK162 or PD0325901) and single agent mTOR inhibition (Everolimus or AZD8055) also blocked cell growth in NRAS mutant cell lines, whereas single agent PI3K inhibitors or MEK Inhibitors in combination with PIK3CA/AKT inhibitors did not show synergistic effects."
1003,"Inhibition of ERK in 11 KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines with SCH772984 was more effective than MEK Inhibition. Combined Treatment with PI3K Inhibitor AZD8186 was more effective than either agent alone. Chemical library screen in two cell lines also identified mTOR, AKT Family Inhibitors (Temsirolimus, Everolimus) to act synergistically with ERK Inhibition."
1004,"Preclinial data from KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines show syngergistic effect on cell viability and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo when MEK and IGF-IR are inhibited concomitantly. In other cell lines, activation of other RTKs (such as MET) were observed upon MEK Inhibition and combination of RTKi and METi also showed synergistic activity. A total of 16 cell lines were used in this study. 6 were KRAS wild type, and 10 harbored various KRAS mutations (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, and Q61L). Additional data was obtained from xenografts."
1005,"49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with BRAF inhibition were analyzed. 21 exhibited primary resistance to BRAF inhibition using PLX4720. Inhibition of MEK1/2 (AZD6244 [selumetinib]) and PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235 [dactolisib]) was the most effective approach to counteract resistance in comparison to inhibition with the PLX4720 (progenitor of vemurafenib)-BEZ235 (where response was assessed by apoptosis, viability, p-ERK, p-Akt inhibition)."
1006,"In-vitro studies using ERBB2 over-expressing breast cancer cell lines BT474 and SKBR3 (with ERBB2 amplification) showed apoptosis under either labatinib or trastuzumab treatment.

1007,"In light of results showing increased PFS using mAB plus TKI in heavily pretreated patients, the efficacy of trastuzumab plus lapatinib in a neoadjuvant setting with untreated stage II or IIIA HER2 positive breast cancer was assessed. In this randomized 3 arm phase II study (CHER-LOB), patients received (A) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, (B) chemotherapy plus lapatinib, or (C) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, with pathologic complete response (pCR) as endpoint. From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C. The authors conclude these results support the superiority of dual-HER2 inhibition in the neoadjuvant context of HER2 positive BC."
1009,"This Phase III study (EGF104900) was motivated by preclinical and other data demonstrating synergistic activity between lapatinib and trastuzumab against HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) cells. In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008). The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment."
1011,"This Phase II trial (LUX-Breast 3 - NCT01441596) compared afatinib, afatinib plus vinorelbine, or investigator's choice of treatment. 121 patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer with CNS recurrence or regression who had previously progressed on trastuzumab or lapatinib were assigned to 3 arms, with endpoint in the intention-to-treat population being patient benefit at 12 weeks defined as absence of CNS or extra CNS progression, no tumor related worsening of neurological symptoms and no increase in corticosteroid dose. Benefit was seen in 30% of 40 patients assigned to afatinib alone, 34.2% of 38 assigned to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 41.9% of 43 assigned to investigator's treatment choice. Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects. While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned."
1013,"Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers. The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC. Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%. The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy."
1016,"One patient in a cohort of 50 patients with metastatic prostate cancer had a frameshift mutation in the MRE11, ATM, MLH3 and NBN genes and showed clinical response to PARP inhibitor olaparib (16 weeks on Treatment)."
1017,"Two human glioma cell lines (U87MG or LNZ308) overexpressing either wild-type (wt) EGFR or EGFRvIII were treated with nimotuzumab, temozolomide, or both in vitro. Anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab were greater in EGFRvIII in comparison to EGFRwt (as measured by antitumor effects, growth suppression, survival elongation and EGFR and Akt phosphorylation). Combination of nimotuzumab and temozolomide further increased efficacy."
1019,"Two patients were found to harbor gene fusions maintaining the kinase domain of NTRK1 (3' partner), specifically: MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1. Both of these fusions lead to constitutive kinase activity and were found to be oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity (ARRY-470, CEP-701 and, to a lesser extent, crizotinib) inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth."
1020,"Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study in archived tumor tissue from 323 patients from the PICCOLO trial (panitumumab plus irinotecan in CRC patients with KRAS wt). Tumors were classified as ""high expressor"" (either EREG or AREG mRNA level) or ""low expressor"" (neither EREG nor AREG in top tertile). For RAS wild-type patients with high ligand expression, median PFS was 8.3 [4.0-11.0] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.4 [2.8-6.7] months (irinotecan alone); HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.61]; P < .001. In RAS wild-type patients with low ligand expression, median PFS was 3.2 [2.7-8.1] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.0 [2.7-7.5] months (irinotecan); HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.64-1.37]; P = .73; interaction test results were significant [P = .01]). Results were less clear for response rate (interaction P = .17) and OS (interaction P = .11)."

1022,"ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice. Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer. Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone). The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer."
1023,"TyTAN, a Phase III study in Asian patients, looked at addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib to chemptherapy in advanced HER2 positive gastric cancer. Primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Participants had progressed under previous treatment and only a small percentage had seen first line trastuzumab. Patients were a mix of those having undergone gastrectomy and not. OS was not significantly different in the ITT population, but certain subpopulations showed significant differences. In the subset of patients showing a stronger immunohistochemistry result for HER2 (IHC3+), progression free survival was significantly different at 5.6 months for lapatinib + pacitaxel vs. 4.2 months for pacitaxel alone. The authors conclude that proof of concept for lapatanib addition to chemotherapy for certain subgroups is provided in this study."
1024,Case Report of a 42-year old patient with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. IHC was focally positive for CD117. Imatinib mesylate led to complete metabolic response (PET-CT).
1025,Case Report of a 41-year old patient with high-grade stromal endometrial sarcoma and a large abdominal and retroperitoneal mass progressing after chemotherapy. IHC for c-Kit was positive and treatment with imatinib led to an objective Response. Surgery was performed and the patient was free of disease two years later.
1030,"In a retrospective study, 30 patients were evaluated after crizotinib treatment for stage IV NSCLC confirmed for ROS1 rearrangement. On crizotinib, 24 of the patients achieved objective responses including 5 complete responses. Median progression free survival was 9.1 months, and all but one patient had been pretreated with 1 or more lines of chemotherapy."
1035,Preclinical studies linking the efficacy of mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 to VHL loss in vitro and in mouse models of kidney cancer. VHL-deficient tumors were more sensitive to mTOR inhibition than VHL-proficient tumors. Growth arrest caused by CCI-779 correlated with a block in translation of HIF1A mRNA. Expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking the 5' untranslated region rescued tumor growth.
1040,13 patients with relapsed or chemo-refractory FLT3-ITD+ AML were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily). 12 patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. Sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days.
1043,"This was a retrospective study of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC who had undergone varied courses of treatment. All tumors were adenocarcinoma with in-frame HER2 exon 20 insertions. In patients (n=57) that had been treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, an overall response rate of 75% and progression free survival of 5.1 months were observed. No standard of care currently exists for HER2-mutant NSCLC. While trastuzumab has not shown clear benefit yet in wild-type HER2 overexpressed NSCLC, the authors conclude that further prospective studies should be done with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in advanced HER2 mutant NSCLC, and that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy should be considered in current treatment courses of this cancer type."
1044,"This report details 2 case studies in relapsed HER2 positive SCLC. In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment. With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months. Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC. Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation. Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months. While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC."
1045,"A 55 year old heavily pretreated patient with equivocal HER2 overexpression (IHC2+ and no amplification in FISH) was found to have the HER2 YMVA kinase domain insertion. Afatinib monotherapy resulted in resolution of symptoms and 10 months before progressive disease. The patient was subsequently given trastuzumab with no response. The observed efficacy of afatinib against M774insAYVM, and studies reporting afatinib activity against other variants in the HER2 kinase domain, are cited by the authors as motivation for the arm of NCI-MATCH focusing on afatinib and activating HER2 mutations."
1047,"Human HER2 with YVMA insertion was put under a clara cell specific, rtTA promoter system inducible via doxycycline. Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline. Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression. Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab."
1048,"In this phase II study (NCT00818441) of dacomitinib in HER2 amplified or mutant NSCLC tumors, three of 26 patients with HER2 p.P780_Y781insGSP or p.M774delinsWLV showed partial responses of duration between 3 and 14 months, while 13 patients with the more common HER2 p. A775_G776insYVMA showed no partial responses. The authors conclude that in the set of activating HER2 mutations, benefits of an individual agent may be specific to certain mutations, and that ""HER2-positive lung cancers"" is not an adequate term to describe this group of distinguishable illnesses."
1050,"Efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2 overexpressing NSCLC remains unclear. In this study using a panel of NSCLC HER2 overexpressing cell lines, antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were observed in a HER2-expression dependant manner, with strongest effects in Calu-3 (high expressing) and no effects in Calu-6 (low expressing). Trastuzumab did not show notable effects on cell growth in any tested cells. HER2 positivity in NSCLC is fairly common at 2-20%. A clinical trial (NCT02289833) is currently underway to asses TDM-1 in HER2 overexpressing lung cancer."
1057,"An EGFR G465R mutation (22% of mutant alleles) was detected in a biopsy from one patient which had been previously treated with cetuximab in the analysis of 15 patients with refractory, metastatic CRC after cetuximab/panitumumab, prior to Sym004 (Futuximab/Modotuximab mixture) treatment. Subsequent treatment of this patient with Sym004 yielded disease stabilization lasting 15 weeks. In vitro analysis in colorectal cancer cell line NIH3T3 with EGFR mutations S492R, R451C, K467T, and G465R showed that antibody mixture Sym004 effectively bound to all mutants, whereas cetuximab and panitumumab did not effectively bind to all mutants. In-vitro, Sym004 inhibited growth of S492R and G465R EGFR mutant cell lines. In-vivo analysis of S492R and G465R mutant cell lines showed regression of S492R and tumor growth delay of G465R mutant cell lines."
1060,"Eighty SNPs in miRNA binding sites of cancer related genes selected from 18,500 miRNA:target bindings in crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) data were investigated in 379 advanced NSCLC patients using a sequenom mass spectrometry-based genotype assay. 16 SNPs were significantly associated with the clinical outcomes after chemotherapy with paclitaxel-cisplatin: ETS2 SNP: OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.00–1.81, P = 0.05; aHR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.94, P = 0.006, under additive model. ETS2 rs461155A>G was significantly associated with decreased ETS2 mRNA expression in both tumor and paired normal lung tissues (Ptrend = 4 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-4, respectively)."
1077,"CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible. The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab. Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved. Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab. These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer."
1078,"Tumor sequencing in pre- and post-therapy specimens from ten individuals with mCRC who experienced disease progression after a prior response to cetuximab with chemotherapy was performed. The S492R mutation was identified in two persons. One of them had already died, the other received treatment with panitumumab and had a partial response (50% tumor reduction in all liver lesions) for 5 months."
1079,"In this preclinical study of cetuximab, panitumumab or sym004 on various EGFR mutations in colorectal cancer. The S492R mutation was sensitive to Sym004 and panitumumab treatment but resistant to cetuximab. Experiments include flow cytometry binding assay, kinase phosphorylation, cell viability, downstream signalling."
1081,"In this preclinical study on the effects of cetuximab, panitumumab or sym004 on various EGFR mutations in colorectal cancer. The R451C mutation showed moderate drug-receptor binding with sym004, cetuximab and panitumumab treatment and inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation."
1082,"In this preclinical study on the effects of cetuximab, panitumumab or sym004 on various EGFR mutations in colorectal cancer. In NIH3T3 cells expressing EGFR with a K467T mutation, Sym004 and panitumumab bound the mutated receptor and inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of ligand while cetuximab neither bound to nor inhibited EGFR phosphorylation of the mutated receptor."
1089,72-year old male patient presents with SCC with a mutation profile consistent with UV exposure. Sequencing revealed a number of abnormalities including P753S mutation in EGFR. Patient began therapy with cetuximab and sirolimus and continued for 9 months. Disease burden was not measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.
1091,ATRA/Arsenic combined with standard chemotherapy has been shown to induce a complete remission rate of greater than 75% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia harboring the PML-RARa fusion.
1095,"64-year old female (non-smoker) was diagnosed with NSCLC. A c.3028 G->A mutation was identified in exon 14 resulting in exon 14 skipping. Further, amplification of the MET gene was observed. The patient was given crizotinib and CT scans showed a positive response after 8 weeks of treatment."
1097,"HER2 expression in uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis and may act as a targetable driver mutation in this cancer. HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women. This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH. Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy. Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL. The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation. Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered. After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL. The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC."
1099,"Saridegib treatment induced tumor reduction and significantly prolonged survival in a Shh-driven mouse medulloblastoma model, and was found to be active in cells with the D473H point mutation."
1101,"Cabozantinib was assessed in the CD74-ROS1-mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74-ROS1. It effectively inhibited the survival of CD74-ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations."
1103,"This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations."
1104,"A t(8;13)(p11;q12) patient with ZNF198-FGFR1-induced progressive myeloproliferative disorder was treated with PKC412. Radiographic studies performed 3 months after initiation of therapy revealed marked improvement of her cervical, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and marked regression of splenomegaly to normal size."
1106,"COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding cDNAs for wild-type or A1065T-mutant KDR. Autophosphorylation was observed on tyrosine of mutant cells, but not wild-type cells, which were starved from serum for 6 hours without rhVEGF stimulation. Decreased phosphorylation in mutant cells was noted after treatment with either sunitinib or sorafenib."
1107,"COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding cDNAs for wild-type or D717V-mutant KDR. Autophosphorylation was observed on tyrosine of mutant cells, but not wild-type cells, which were starved from serum for 6 hours without rhVEGF stimulation. Decreased phosphorylation in mutant cells was noted after treatment with either sunitinib or sorafenib."
1108,"The pretreatment tumor contained a somatic nonsense mutation (Q1178*) in the tumor-suppressor gene TSC2 that inactivates the gene, allowing for activation of the mTOR pathway and resulting in sensitivity to mTOR inhibition by everolimus. The patient received a sustained response to everolimus for 18 months."
1113,"In this two arm, Phase III study (NCT00878709) of the efficacy of a 12 month course of the TKI neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer was assessed using invasive disease-free survival as primary endpoint. HER2 positivity was assessed via FISH. At 2 year follow-up, 70 vs. 109 disease-free survival events had occurred and disease-free survival rates were 93.9% vs. 91.6% (significant) in neratinib vs. placebo groups respectively. Distant disease-free survival and time to distant recurrence were similar in both groups. These results are an interesting contrast to results of long-term adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (HERA) which did not show significant benefit."
1115,"FaDu (a high ALDH1A2 expression cell line) and Cal27 (a low expression cell line) were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Adapalene or Fenretinide. This led to concentration dependent decrease in the survival fraction in both cell lines with higher efficacy in Cal27 (ED50 ≈ 1 μM) as compared to FaDu cells (ED ≈ 44 μM). Treatment with 3 μM ATRA sensitized Cal27 cells to irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy, but had no or only a minor effect on ALDH1A2-postitive cells."
1118,"Researchers studied the effect of CIP2A expression in relation to gemcitabine sensitivity via SW1990 cell lines. SW1990 cells with CIP2A expression knocked-down displayed lower IC50 (p=.024), indicating a sensitivity to gemcitabine."
1122,"HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting. Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated. At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone. A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm. 1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care."
1125,"A 51-year old female never smoker with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma carrying a HER2 insertion in exon 20 (p.A775_G776insYVMA) by sequencing archived material, HER2 overexpression by IHC (2+) and HER2 amplification by in situ hybridization was treated with T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine). Patient received two cycles off-label at 3.6mg/kg and was found to have morphologic response of lung and bone lesions by PET and CT. TDM-1 therapy was ongoing as of publication April 2015."
1128,Expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was evaluated in 26 patients with glioblastomas treated with erlotinib or gefitinib and no EGFR or Her2/neu kinase domain mutations. 7 patients responded to treatment while 19 progressed rapidly. Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was associated with clinical response (defined as 25% tumor shrinkage). These results were confirmed using IHC in an independent cohort of 33 patients (8 responders) treated with erlotinib at another institution.

1132,"This Phase III trial took patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 (ERBB2) positive breast cancer that had progressed on prior trastuzumab treatment. Patients were given capecitabine (n=161) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=163). The primary endpoint of the study was time to progression. Median time to progression was 4.4 months in the capecitabine group and 8.4 months in capecitabine plus lapatinib group (hazard ratio was 0.49 ; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.71; P<0.001). The results indicated that lapatinib may be useful in addressing the problem of trastuzumab progression in HER2 breast cancer."
1133,"In this Phase III trial, trastuzumab-based treatment was assessed in women with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab. Patients had 12 weeks or greater previous trastuzumab treatment with time since end of last cycle less than 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was time to progression. 78 patients were assigned to each group, with median time to progression of 5.6 months in capecitabine group and 8.2 months in trastuzumab plus capecitabine group. The results are in contrast to the principle of change of treatment on disease progression, and authors suggest that chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanisms of trastuzumab remain intact in HER2 breast cancer cells with trastuzumab progression."
1136,"Patients with relapsed/refractory AML or 60 years old or more with untreated AML were enrolled on a phase II study of selumetinib and analyzed for mutations in KIT, NRAS, KRAS and FLT3. KIT mutation analysis (N=41) revealed the presence of a synonymous SNP rs3733542 (known population frequency of 20%) in exon 18 of the KIT gene in six of ten (60%) patients assessed as having a response or disease stabilization to selumetinib. In contrast, this SNP was detected in only seven of 31 (23%) patients without a response or disease stabilization (P = 0.027, Chi-squared test)."
1138,"Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. TBK1 depletion (siRNA) inhibited migration and invasion, whereas its constitutive overexpression led to an increase in invasion. In MEK-resistant NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, TBK1 depletion or inhibition (AZ909) in combination with MEK inhibitors (selumetinib) promoted apoptosis in 3D culture."
1140,"Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK Inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations."
1141,"Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK by GDC-0973 (cobimetinib) is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours. This study provides mechanistic rationale for improved efficacy of cobimetinib in BRAF-mutant models compared to MEK inhibitors acting through an alternative mechanism (GDC-0623 and G-573)."
1142,"83 patients from a phase II trial (docetaxel + placebo or MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib) with KRAS mutant tumors were retrospectively assessed for differences in OS, PFS, ORR and change in tumor size at week 6 according to type of KRAS mutation. G12C, G12D and G12V were the most common mutations (46%, 22%, 11%, respectively). Patients with G12C or G12V mutations receiving selumetinib and docetaxel combined treatment had a trend towards longer OS, PFS and ORR compared to other KRAS mutations, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Changes in tumor size were similar between groups with the best responses in tumors with G12V mutations. Few differences were observed between groups when treated with docetaxel + placebo."

1145,A clinical trial comparing selumetinib and docetaxel vs. docetaxel and placebo in KRAS mutant NSCLC was recapitulated in mice. Tumors were induced in lung epithelium by nasal instillation of CRE-bearing adenovirus in conditionally targeted mice. Kras(G12D) and Trp53 knockout mutant mice were resistant to docetaxel monotherapy but sensitive to combined treatment. In a small number of human NSCLC patients with these genotypes FDG-PET signal intensity changes and pERK IHC staining correlated with mouse data.
1149,"Pooled analysis of TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) from 4 randomized trials (IALT, JBR10, CALGB-9633 and ANITA, 1209 patients, median follow-up 5.5 years) of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus observation (OBS). Patients with wild-type TP53 had better outcomes with ACT than OBS (HROS=0.77 [0.62-0.95], p=0.02; HRDFS=0.75 [0.62-0.92], p=0.005)."
1151,"In a preclinical study in an immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3, aka HAVCR2) was observed after progression under PD-1 antibody. A survival advantage was observed with the addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody."
1152,"Preclinical study in KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer models. A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy."
1156,"MMP2 serum levels were assessed (ELISA) at baseline (b) and before surgery in 45 available samples from patients with inflammatory breast cancer treated with bevacizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. High bMMP2 was correlated with better disease-free survival (DFS, p=0.001) and overall survival (OS, p=0.032). Correlation to DFS was also found after multivariate analysis (p=0.003, Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.115). bMMP2 was associated with relapse (p=0.002) and death (p=0.049). During treatment, significant increase in MMP2 was observed in 100% of patients."
1158,"Plasma levels of 11 potential biomarkers were tested at baseline and 2 weeks after bevacizumab initiation in a prospective cohort of 26 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Results were validated in a separate retrospective cohort (n = 50) and also tested in patients treated with cytotoxic agents without bevacizumab (n = 34). MMP2 level was correlated with PFS (hazard ratio, 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.46-10.52; P = .007) and OS (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI: 1.58-13.53; P = .005) in the discovery and validation cohorts but not in patients treated without bevacizumab."
1159,"The Phase III trial, TH3RESA (NCT01419197), was performed in patients with advanced HER2 breast cancer that was heavily pretreated. Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane. This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physician's choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198). Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physician's choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1. The authors conclude that their findings in this heavily pretreated population, along with findings in the EMILIA trial, indicate promise for antibody-drug conjugates. The NCI-MATCH trial with further study T-DM1 in the context of HER2 amplification."
1160,"The EMILIA study (NCT00829166) was a Phase II trial to assess the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=495) in comparison to lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=496), in treatment of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1. Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine. Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine. These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial."
1163,"49 patients gastric cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy were immunohistochemically assessed for nuclear HSPH1 (HSP110) expression. Overall survival rate in the high expression group (2+ moderate/3+ strong staining) was significantly lower compared with the low expression group (0 no/1+ weak staining) (P = 0.0364). In gastric cancer cell lines (MKN7, MKN45), siRNA mediated HSP110 knockdown led to a higher sensitivity to 5-FU and cisplatin compared with the parent and control cells (p < 0.05)."
1164,"329 consecutive patients with stage II–III colorectal tumors with MSI after surgical resection at tertiary medical centers were screened for HSP110 T(17) by PCR. Patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Patients with large HSP110 T(17) deletions (≥5 bp; 18 of 77 patients, 23.4%) had longer times of relapse-free survival than patients with small or no deletions (≤4 bp; 59 of 77 patients, 76.6%) in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.012–0.8; P = .03).

1170,"19 advanced sarcoma patients treated with pazopanib were retrospectively assessed for mutations associated with response using the Foundation one sarcoma/heme panel. Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with TP53 mutations (all predicted to be loss of function) was significantly greater than TP53 wild-type tumors with the median PFS of 208 versus 136 days, respectively [P = 0.036, hazards ratio 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.83)]."
1172,"Exploratory biomarker analysis from a phase-II randomized trial comparing atezolizumab (PD-L1) and docetaxel in previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Baseline PD-L1 expression (IHC) was assessed in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%).

1173,"Preclinical study to investigate mechanisms of KRAS G12C activity and inhibition with ARS-853, a covalent (irreversible) inhibitor which binds KRAS G12C in the GDP-bound state to prevent activation. Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay. Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF."

1175,"Updated results from ASCEND-1 trial assessing safety and activity of ceritinib in ALK rearranged locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK-rearranged NSCLC (Median follow-up: 11.1 months). Overall response rate was 72% [95% CI 61-82] of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 56% [49-64] of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17·0 months (95% CI 11.3-non-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8.3 months (6.8-9.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18.4 months (95% CI 11.1-NE) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6.9 months (5.6-8.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Brain metastases control was reported in 79% [95% CI 54-94] of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 65% [54-76] of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients."

1183,"CDK1 was identified in a preclinical siRNA screen to identify targets in KRAS mutant tumors. Cell viability was evaluated following knockdown of 834 genes in isogenic LIM1215 colorectal cancer cell lines harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D or G12V KRAS. 6 targets identified by this screen were evaluated in a second set of isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines (SW48) harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D, G12V or G13D KRAS where only CDK1 knockdown more profoundly reduced survival in mutant cells compared to wildtype. Results were validated in 5 KRAS mutant (BRAF WT) and 10 KRAS WT colorectal cancer cell lines. Chemical inhibition of CDK1 by AZD5438 in KRAS mutant vs WT pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines showed increased efficacy in mutant cell lines. Finally, AZD5438 reduced tumor growth induced by SW620 (KRAS p.G12V) colorectal tumour cells xenografted into immunodeficient mice."
1185,A single patient with a MET c.3028G>A (splice donor site of exon 14) mutation exhibited clinical sensitivity to the c-Met inhibitor crizotinib. Exon 14 skipping was detected using qRT-PCR. Response to the therapy was demonstrated by comparing CAT scans obtained before treatment to those obtained during treatment (at 2 months of crizotinib therapy).
1186,"A patient with MET c.3028+1G>T mutation (METex14) had partial response (tumor reduction of 61%) after 13 months capmatinib. MET gene copy number was four, MET FISH 13.8 copy number, and IHC 3+."
1187,"In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances."
1188,"A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci. Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation. BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC, and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment."
1189,"In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%."
1190,"Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing. 5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not. These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib."
1191,"Case Report of a 84-year-old woman with stage IVb CRC after progression under 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab. NGS revealed a frameshift mutation in APC, a missense mutation in KRAS. Variants of uncertain significance were: a missense variant in ERBB2 and a missense variant in KDR at amino acid 961 converting the wild type residue, Arginine, to Tryptophan (frequency 28.25%). Because of the high frequency of the KDR (VEGFR2) mutation, the patient was considered a suitable candidate for a VEGFR inhibitor and received regorafenib monotherapy, which is approved for this situation, at 80mg daily which was later reduced to 40mg daily and had CEA normalization as well as partial metabolic and radiologic response. The patient remained almost asymptomatic and without disease progression after 39 weeks."
1192,"In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20. 3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice. The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line. The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants."
1193,"In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants. Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant. Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31. In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease. These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines."
1194,"In a panel of 602 cancer cell lines, 3/134 NSCLC cell lines showed <0.5% cell viability following treatment with the ALK inhibitor TAE684. Of these, NCI-H2228 harbored EML4-ALK variant 3a/b (EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20). TAE684 inhibited Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in H2228 cells and appeared to induce a cytostatic response."
1196,"EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus. While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate. While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity. Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion."
1198,"This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported."
1199,"This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported."
1200,"This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident. Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001)."
1201,"This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level."
1202,"In this study, heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with various molecular tumor makeup were treated with Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 to assess overall response rate. The study did not reach the targeted endpoint of 20% ORR. However, of 3/12 patients found to be ALK-rearranged via break apart FISH assay, 2 showed a partial response and the third stable disease, which was durable for 7.2 months. The authors note that the break apart FISH assay used to determine ALK-rearrangement status does not determine the identity of the ALK fusion partner and the promising results shown here may be dependent on the nature of the ALK fusion partner."
1203,"In preclinical work using H3122 NSCLC cells which contain the EML4-ALK variant 1, administration of the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 caused marked decrease of EML4-ALK protein levels at concentrations lower than those used to knock down protein levels of drivers such as HER2 or EGFR in other cell lines, making it the most sensitive Hsp90 client protein the authors had encountered. IPI-504 treatment caused regression of H3122 tumors in nude mice, whereas Hsp90 inhibitors usually only cause growth inhibition in these models. Combined treatment of these mice with IPI-504 and crizotinib caused an even stronger tumor regression."
1204,"EML4-ALK fusions occur in 2-7% of lung adenocarcinomas. Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition. EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells."
1206,"Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 1 causes IL3 independent growth. Incubation of EML4-ALK variant 1 transduced Ba/F3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation, and that EML4-ALK variant 1 is a client protein of Hsp90. The degree of Hsp90 dependence, and targetability of EML4-ALK for Hsp90 inhibition, may vary among ALK fusion variants. Addition of crizotinib to 17-DMAG caused synergistic death effects, suggesting potential clinical benefit for this inhibitor combination in targeting EML4-ALK variant 1."
1207,"In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants. 13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate."
1210,"Preclinical study in uveal melanoma cell lines. Cell lines (n=4) with GNAQ mutation (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202) were more sensitive to BRD4 inhibition with JQ1 than GNAQ/GNA11 wild type (n=3) cell line. JQ1 also inhibited growth of a GNAQ mutant cell line (92.1) in a mouse xenograft model compared to vehicle (N=5 mice/group)."
1211,"Preclinical study in uveal melanoma cell lines. Cell lines (n=5) with GNAQ (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202) or GNA11 (Omm1) mutation were more sensitive to BRD4 inhibition with JQ1 than GNAQ/11 wild type (n=3) cell line."
1214,"Two siblings (6 and 3.5 years) from nonconsanguineous parents were diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. Both tumors harbored TP53 mutations and lack of MGMT promoter hypermethylation as poor prognostic markers. Germline homozygous c.2117delA, p. Lys706SerfsX19 mutation in PMS2, loss of PMS2 staining in the tumor and normal tissue confirmed a diagnosis of biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD). Both tumors harbored driver mutations in POLE and were found to harbor 24,680 and 21,919 mutations per exome. Neoantigen load was assessed in 37 bMMRD patients and all malignant tumors had high numbers of predicted neoantigens (7-16x as high as in melanoma, lung or other immunoresponsive cancers). Treatment with nivolumab was begun and both patients had radiologic response. After 9 and 5 months of therapy, respectively, the patient and her brother resumed normal schooling and daily activities."
1220,"In a phase 1 clinical trial for the use of trametinib for various advanced solid tumors, 22 out of 30 NSCLC patients harbored KRAS mutations. Of those 22 patients with mutant KRAS, 8 saw reductions in tumor size ranging from 6-52% including 2 partial responses."
1221,"In a phase III clinical trial comparing different doses of imatinib in GIST patients, KIT exon 9 mutations were associated with significantly improved progression free survival (P=0.0013) and a 61% relative risk reduction in response to the higher dose regimen (N=31; 800mg/daily) when compared to the lower dose regimen (N=27; 400 mg/daily; HR 0.329; 95% CI 0.218–0.706). The same dose dependent responses were not observed with KIT exon 11 mutations (N=130 vs 118; P=0.25; HR 0.821; 95% CI 0.585–1.151) or with wild-type KIT (N=25 vs 27; P=0.07; HR 1.823; 95% CI 0.938–3.543)."
1222,"In a phase II clinical trial of 43 melanoma patients harboring KIT mutations or amplifications, imatinib treatment exhibited significant anti-tumor activity with a median progression free survival of 3.5 months, tumor regression in 41.9% of patients, and a 1-year overall survival rate of 51%. 9/10 partial responses were in patients with exon 11 or 13 KIT mutations."

1231,"In a phase II trial on castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, FISH detection of PTEN deletion was associated with increased progression free survival (p=0.07) and with improved PSA response (p=0.02) in response to everolimus, an mTOR pathway inhibitor."
1233,"Phase 1 study of MAPK1/2 inhibitor BAY 86-9766. 53 patients were evaluated for efficacy, one patients achieved a PR and 11 patients had stable disease. One ocular melanoma patient with prolonged stable disease, who later went on to complete 28 courses, was positive for GNAQ Q209L and PTEN R173S mutations. The PTEN mutation was identified only in the postdose biopsy and not in the predose biopsy."
1234,"Somatic and germline BAP1 mutations are associated with uveal melanoma. In this preclinical study, gene set enrichment analysis revealed HDAC inhibitors as potential drugs in BAP1 mutant uveal melanomas. HDAC inhibitors VPA, TSA, LBH-589, and SAHA (vorinostat) were tested in-vitro and led to decreased proliferation (all inhibitors) decreased viability and cytotoxicity (TSA, SAHA, LBH-589) in-vitro and in-vivo (VPA). RNAi mediated BAP1 knockdown increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibition (VPA)."
1235,"A siRNA screen identified BAP1 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression. HDAC2 or BAP1 depletion sensitized a mesothelioma cell line (MSTO-211H) to HDAC inhibitors MC1568, vorinostat or mocetinostat. The paper indicates however, that temporary BAP knockdown might not adequately reflect long-term BAP1 mutation."
1236,"Preclinical study in endometrial cancer cell lines (MFE-296, AN3CA, MFE-280 and Ishikawa). In cell proliferation assays, the three FGFR2 mutant cell lines were more sensitive to the pan-FGFR inhibitor ponatinib (AP24534) than the FGFR2 wild type cell line (Ishikawa) and human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). Ponatinib also inhibited FGFR2 kinase activity and phosphorylation (MFE-296 and MFE-280) as well as cell migration and invasion (MFE-296 and AN3CA) of FGFR2 mutated cancer cell lines."
1237,"In a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01283516) 130 patients with advanced cancers all harboring ALK alterations were treated with ceritinib. Of 114 NSCLC patients treated with at least 400 mg/daily ceritinib, 1 had a complete response, 65 had a partial response, 25 had stable disease, 12 had progressive disease, and 11 withdrew from the study early. Ceritinib dosed at 400 mg or higher had similar results in patients who had or had not received prior crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate for patients with prior crizotinib treatment (83 out of 122) was 56% with median progression free survival of 6.9 months. For patients who had no prior crizotinib treatment, median progression free survival was 10.4 months."
1239,"NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was the first ALK-fusion to be discovered and characterized. In this study, targeted activity against NPM-ALK by the ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib was assessed in cell lines and tumor xenograft models. Treatment of NPM-ALK positive ALCL cell lines Karpas299 and SU-DHL-1 potently inhibited growth, and this was seen to occur at concentrations which also inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in these cells. Administration of 100mg/kg/d crizotinib resulted in complete regression of all tumors, indicating that NPM-ALK could be an effective target for crizotinib in ALCL."
1240,"Crizotinib at 250mg daily was given to two patients with relapsed ALK-rearranged anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive). The authors conclude these two cases indicate sensitivity to crizotinib of relapsed ALK-rearranged ALCL."
1241,"In the second part of this Phase I study NCT00939770, nine patients between the ages of 12 months and 22 years with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), who were refractory to treatment and for whom no further known treatments were available, were treated with crizotinib. Six patients with detectable NPM-ALK transcript levels responded with partial response, 1 with complete response, and 1 with stable disease. Crizotinib was well tolerated in these children."
1243,"As part of a phase 1 dose-escalation trial (NCT00939770), seven patients between ages 12 months and 22 years with relapsed or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors with ALK-rearrangement were given crizotinib. In six patients with measurable disease, responses included 3 with partial response and 3 with stable disease. One patient with evaluable disease had stable disease with treatment ongoing at the time of publication. Crizotinib was well tolerated in this group of pediatric patients."
1244,"ALK-rearrangements are seen in 50% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) cases. A 44 year old man was diagnosed with IMT. He was treated with surgery and catheter placement for administration of cisplatin, doxyrubicin and mitomycin C. Break-apart FISH showed ALK rearrangement, and immunohistochemical staining was characteristic of RANBP2 rearrangement. After further chemotherapy along with maintenance imatinib, crizotinib was started at 200mg twice daily, and a maximal partial response was achieved 5 months later, with regrowth occurring 2 months later. After further surgery, crizotinib was restarted at 250mg twice daily and almost 2 years later the patient was in complete radiographic remission. Another patient with non-ALK rearranged IMT was administered crizotinib in this study but did not respond."
1245,"This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination."
1246,"116 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples were analyzed in this study. 2 patient's samples underwent whole genome sequencing, tumor samples from 51 patients underwent exome sequencing and expression analysis, 63 samples underwent FGFR1 copy number analysis, mRNA analysis and IHC. A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft. Ponatinib treatment inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines."

1248,"Case report of a 77-year old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma (T2aN1M0, stage IIA) without EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF mutations, and no ALK gene rearrangement. CD72-ROS1 was identified in sequencing after progression on chemotherapy. Crizotinib at 250 mg orally twice daily led to resolution of metastatic disease. The patient remained disease-free for 13 months when a CT-scan showed a relapse with two nodules in the right lower lobe. Stereotactic radiation therapy, gamma knife radiosurgery, and ipilimumab did not lead to a relevant response (new pleural nodules, new intracranial metastases). The patient next received ceritinib on a ""Signature Trial"" for tumors with aberrations in ALK or ROS1 that are treated with oral ceritinib (LDK378) at 750 mg daily (NCT02186821). Restaging scans after two cycles showed a partial response confirmed after four cycles (56% decrease) per RECIST1.1. MRI showed that his brain metastases decreased as well."
1249,"Preclinical study analyzing the efficacy of dual ROS1/ALK and more specific ROS1 inhibitors on cell lines (Ba/F3) expressing CD74-ROS1 with and without the G2032R mutation. Selective ROS1 inhibitors retained activity against the G2032R mutation (cabozatinib, foretinib), whereas dual ALK/ROS inhibitors (crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, AZD3463) or ALK-selective inhibitors (alectinib) were ineffective."
1251,"Preclinical study of PF-06463922 in NSCLC in-vitro, in-vivo and in enzyme assays. PF-06463922 showed inhibition of kinase activity, cell viability and tumor growth in wild-type, G2032R and L2026M mutations in ROS1."
1253,"Preclinical study of PF-06463922 in NSCLC in-vitro, in-vivo, and in enzyme assays. After establishing that the CD74-ROS1 L2026M mutation confers crizotinib resistance in kinase activity and cell viability assays (in transduced BaF3 cells), response to PF-06463922 was tested. Wild-type CD74-ROS1, CD74-ROS1 G2032R, and CD74-ROS1 L2026M all showed sensitivity to PF-06463922 in these assays."
1255,"Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 G2032R showed resistance to crizotinib, compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1 (~128 fold higher IC50); however, showed relative sensitivity to foretinib (only ~6 fold higher IC50 than WT)."
1258,Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 L2026M mutation showed similar sensitivity to foretinib compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1. This is in contrast to the increased resistance to crizotinib associated with this mutation in the same assay.
1260,"Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74–ROS1 G2101A showed resistance to crizotinib, compared with those expressing wild-type CD74–ROS1, and were sensitive to foretinib."
1261,"A cell line called LM1 was established from the bone marrow of a 13 year old female patient with relapsed CLTC-ALK positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient had been heavily treated with chemotherapy before establishment of the cell line. The cell line maintained the tumor immunophenotype. SNP analysis of patient bone marrow mononuclear cells and LM1 showed chromosomal changes associated with the cell line but 94.7% of SNPs were identically called. ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 induced cell death in LM1 cells at low nanomolar concentrations, while it did not significantly effect the ALK-rearrangement negative DLBCL cell line Karpas422. LM1 cells formed tumors in 3/10 SCID and 9/10 NOD-SCID mice. CD30 and CD138 immmunostaining were maintained between original tumor and LM1 xenografts. In mice, LM1 but not Karpas422 xenografts regressed with TAE684 administration, and complete remission for 13 weeks was observed before experiment was terminated."
1264,"A 27 year old female patient with advanced-stage IV, CD20 negative diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL."
1265,"A 21 year old male presented with lymphadenopathy and a low density mass in pancreas. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course."
1267,"Cells harboring in-frame deletions in BRAF in the L485-P490 amino acid region were found to be sensitive to the RAF dimer inhibitor LY3009120, but not sensitive to the BRAF-selective inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. These deletions were observed in KRAS wildtype pancreatic, ovarian, NSCLC, and thyroid cancers. In three cell lines H2405 (NSCLC with L485-P490>Y), BxPC-3 (pancreatic with V487-P492>A), and OV-90 (ovarian with N486-P490del), BRAF deletion–mediated MAPK activation was found to be sensitive to LY3009120 as evidenced by dose-dependent inhibition of phospho-MEK and ERK and cell growth inhibition with IC50 values of 0.04, 0.087, and 0.007 μmol/L in these three cell lines. LY3009120, but not vemurafenib, also inhibited tumor growth of both H2405 and BxPC-3 cells xenografted into mice."
1269,"This Phase I study of crizotinib involved a cohort of pediatric neuroblastoma patients between ages 12 months and 22 years. In 11 patients with characterized ALK mutations, 4 had R1275Q mutations, and two of these were germline mutations. Of these 2 germline patients, 1 showed stable disease (SD) and 1 complete response (CR). In contrast, in the 7 characterized patients with ALK mutations that were not R1275Q, 6 showed PD and 1 SD. The authors conclude this finding is promising and merits further study."
1270,"A cohort of pediatric neuroblastoma patients ages 12 months to 22 years were assessed for response to crizotinib in a Phase I study. 11 patients in this cohort had characterized ALK mutations, 4 of which were R1275Q mutation. Two of these R1275Q mutations were germline and two were somatic. Of these 2 somatic R1275Q patients, 1 showed progressive disease (PD) and 1 showed stable disease (SD). In contrast, of the 7 characterized patients with ALK mutations that were not R1275Q, 6 showed PD and 1 SD. The stable disease patient had an R1275L mutation in ALK. In general, patients with germline or somatic R1275Q mutations or R1275L mutations had 1 complete response, 3 SD and one PD, while patients with other ALK mutations had 6 PD."
1272,"In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC."
1273,"In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient."
1279,"In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier."
1282,"In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment."
1284,"The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from an NSCLC patient with ALK-rearrangement who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib. the cell line was also resistant to crizotinib and alectinib, and sequencing of ALK from the cell line revealed the I1171T mutation. Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months."
1285,"The I1171T ALK kinase domain mutaion was found in the MGH056-1 cell line which was derived from an ALK rearranged NSCLC patient who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib given at lower dose (300mg twice daily). Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK I1171T in Ba/F3 cells made these cells moderately resistant to crizotinib and resistant to alectinib. In contrast, the frequently used tool compound TAE684 was equally effective against EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T, causing cell death at 1000x lower concentration then in unaltered Ba/F3 cells supplemented with IL3."
1289,"Passaging of the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK containing H3122 NSCLC cell line with increasing levels of alectinib resulted in an alectinib resistant derivative of this cell line named H3122 CHR-A1. A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt."
1290,"The V1180L mutation in the kinase domain of rearranged ALK was found in an alectinib resistant cell line named H3122 CHR-A1, which was derived from the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 by passaging into higher concentrations of alectinib. This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3."
1291,"ALK mutation V1180L was found in an H3122 derivative cell line that had become alectinib resistant after being passaged in increasing levels of alectinib. EML4-ALK V1180L and EML4-ALK wild-type were ectopically expressed in Ba/F3 cells, and brigatinib showed strong activity against both variants. The IC50 for brigatinib against EML4-ALK wild-type was 0.95, which is about 3x higher than the IC50 that was observed for alectinib, but about 6x lower than that for crizotinib. In contrast, the IC50 for brigatinib against the alectinib resistance variant EML4-ALK V1180L was 0.49, indicating increased sensitivity to brigatinib over non mutant EML4-ALK."
1295,"In a phase 2 clinical study of 95 AML/high-risk MDS patients treated with either 50 or 100 mg midostaurin, 35 harbored FLT3 mutations (26 had FLT3 ITD, 9 had FLT3 D835Y mutations). A higher percentage of patients saw blast reductions in the FLT3 mutant group than in the FLT3 wild type group (71 vs 42%). Only one permanent response occurred in a FLT3 mutant patient receiving the 100 mg dose. No differences were observed in toxicity or response rate between the two doses of midostaurin."
1296,"Archival tumor samples from 549 patients from the BOLERO-1 and -3 trials were analyzed for alterations in the PI3K pathway using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Sanger sequencing. In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PI3K mutations had longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.67 95%CI 0.45 to 1.00, P=0.05) whereas patients with PI3K wild type status did not benefit significantly (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46, P=0.5). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combinedly analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway. These trends were independently confirmed in both trials but only pooled results showed consistent statistical significance."

In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PTEN loss (as defined by IHC staining intensity and proportion of positive tumor cells) had a longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.54 (95%CI 0.31 to 0.96, P=0.04) whereas patients with PTEN normal status had a hazard ration of 1.00 (95%CI 0.8 to 1.26, P=0.97).

1301,"A tissue microarray of 268 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma was performed to search for ROS1 gene fusion events to guide potential targeted therapy in future cases. Break apart FISH assay, which does not distinguish ROS1-fusion partner, was used on the tissue microarray to determine ROS1 fusion status. 2 cases of ROS1 fusions were found. 1 case was verified by RT-PCR to be a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, but this case was also positive for BRAF V600E. The second case of ROS1 fusion was of undetermined fusion partner, where known ROS1 fusion parters SLC34A2, CD74 and SDC4 were tested. This case did not have KRAS or BRAF mutations, indicating that ROS1 fusion may act in a small subset of colorectal cancer as a driver targetable by crizotinib or other inhibitors."
1305,"In a patient with gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer, a tumor-derived xenograft was found to be responsive to Mitomycin C. After disease progression, the patient was started on a regimen of mitomycin C, and the patient was shown to be asymptomatic after 3 years of follow-up."
1307,"In the pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC homozygous deletion) and Hs766T (FANCG-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed. PL11 cells (empty vector transduced) were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin, chlorambucil, and melphalan than PL11 cells transduced with a vector wildtype FANCC. Similarly, mouse xenografts of PL11 cells (empty vector) were more sensitive to MMC or gemcitabine than PL11 cells expressing a wildtype FANCC."
1308,"In pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC-deficient) and CAPAN1 (BRCA2-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed compared to FANCC/BRCA2 wildtype cell lines (Su86.86, CFPAC, AsPc1, and MiaPaCa2). Mitomycin C specifically led to regression in 8/11 xenografts of the CAPAN1 cell line compared to 2/9 in the CFPAC (BRCA2 wildtype) cell line."
1309,15/127 patients with KIT-WT metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors were tested for PDGFRA mutations. 6 GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations. 1 patient had a deletion of I843. CHO cells expressing this variant showed similar sensitivity to imatinib as cells expressing wildtype PDGFRA. 2/3 patients with a mutation determined to be sensitive in vitro achieved partial response on imatinib treatment. It is not noted whether the patient whose GISTs harbored I843del had partial response or progressive disease.
1310,"A 10-year-old boy with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia refractory to conventional chemotherapy and harboring an EBF1-PDGFRB fusion responded to imatinib plus induction chemotherapy (vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisone, and intrathecal methotrexate). Complete remission was achieved with bone marrow MRD of 0.059% by flow cytometry and normal PDGFRB by FISH. Consolidation therapy with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, and imatinib followed and the patient was still in remission 10 months after beginning imatinib."
1319,Cell lines with various putative activating mutations were tested for sensitivity to rapamycin. The cell line JHUEM7 with the MTOR mutation S2215Y was hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (IC50 of 0.23 nmol/L).
1320,"Cell lines with various putative activating mutations were tested for sensitivity to rapamycin. The cell line MOLT16, with MTOR mutation C1483Y was hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (IC50 of 0.75 nmol/L)."
1321,"Cell lines with various putative activating mutations were tested for sensitivity to rapamycin. The cell line SNU349, with MTOR mutation E1799K was hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (IC50 of 0.19 nmol/L)."
1322,"The endometrial cancer cell lines, AN3CA and MFE296, which carry the N550K FGFR2 mutation, were found to be sensitive to FGFR inhibition with PD174074 (10 to 40x more sensitive than cell lines with wild type FGFR2.)."
1325,"Exome and RNA sequencing was performed in tumor and matched normal tissue of 19 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The variant PPP1R15A (rs557806) showed the most significant association (P = 0.000401) with FOLFIRI-bevacizumab-driven tumor inhibition rate in exome sequencing data and the highest correlation (r = 0.74) with the drug responses in RNA sequencing data. Patients who were homozygous for the reference alleles (GG) of PPP1R15A rs557806 exhibited greater disease control rates and a tendency toward greater overall response rate than those with homozygous or heterozygous substitution alleles (GC and CC; P = 0.027 and 0.073) when treated with bevacizumab-containing regimens. PPP1R15A rs557806 nonsignificantly correlated with DCR in multivariate analysis (P = 0.054). In HCT116 xenograft tumors, tumor growth IR with FRB was 25 % in mock cells, 24 % in clones with reference alleles (G alleles) of PPP1R15A rs557806, and 17 % in clones with substitution alleles (C alleles) of PPP1R15A rs557806 (P = 0.004, day 13). FDG-PET imaging on day 7 showed FDG uptake (mean SUV max) of 0.219 and 0.500 in HCT116 xenografts expressing the reference allele (G) and substitution allele (C) of PPP1R15A rs557806, respectively (P = 0.032)."
1326,"31 patients with KRAS exon 2 mutation (codons 12 and 13) were treated with selumetinib and irinotecan. All patients had ECOG status 0 or 1 and confirmed progression after first line therapy with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Patients with more than one line of therapy, MEK or B-RAF inhibitor treatment or prior irinotecan treatment were excluded. The study was terminated before full accrual due to non-protocol considerations. Three patients had a PR, 16 patients had SD >= 4 weeks. Median PFS for all patients was 105 days, median OS was 267 days."
1327,"The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line containing the F1174L ALK mutation was found to undergo cell death when treated with the ALK/IGF1R inhibitor AZD3463. These cells were more sensitive than other neuroblastoma cell lines containing wild-type ALK. Marked inhibition of soft agar colony formation of SH-SY5Y cells was also observed with drug treatment. AZD3463 inhibited Akt signaling in these cells within two hours of treatment, and activated apoptosis and autophagy pathways. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells implanted into left kidneys of nude mice resulted in almost complete tumor regression."
1329,"Efficacy of the second generation ALK inhibitor PF-06463922 was tested on ALK mutation F1174L containing neuroblastoma-derived cells. COG-N-453x and SH-SY5Y xenografts showed some inhibition when treated with crizotinib, but showed complete growth inhibition with PF-06463922 treatment. This corresponded to 0% event free survival (EFS) in these mice by 6 weeks with crizotinib treatment, but 100% EFS with PF-06463922 treatment. Comparison of crizotinib and PF-06463922 growth inhibition in F1174L cells SH-SY5Y, NBSD 415-IMDM and KELLY showed increased sensitivity to PF-06463922, as compared to crizotinib. Inhibition effects were not seen on neuroblastoma cells with wild type ALK (NB-EBc1, SK-N-BE(2)C). Decreased phosphorylation on ALK tyrosine 1278 was seen with PF-06463922 over crizotinib at 10 and 100 nM concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells. PF-06463922 was well tolerated in the in-vivo models."
1330,"Patient derived xenografts of neuroblastoma Felix cells with F1245C ALK mutation in CB17 SCID mice showed growth inhibition with crizotinib treatment over control, and mice had improved duration of event-free survival (EFS) with crizotinib treatment over vehicle, but EFS with crizotinib went down to 0% by six weeks. In contrast, PF-06463922 treatment induced complete tumor regression and EFS rate of 100% at six weeks. PF-06463922 inhibited viability in Felix cells at 37x efficacy over crizotinib, with IC50 values of 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 814.0 +/- 119 respectively. PF-06463922 was well tolerated in the animal models."
1331,"In NB-1643 and LAN-5 neuroblastoma cell lines containing R1275Q mutation, PF-06463922 showed 51 and 19 fold greater effect on cell viability over crizotinib treatment respectively. ALK wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines did not show differential sensitivity to the treatments within the sensitivity range of R1275Q cells, and had IC50 values above 3800 nM to the inhibitors. NB-1653 cells induced tumors in CB17 SCID mice and crizotinib treatment inhibited tumor growth over vehicle treatment, but PF-06463922 induced complete tumor regression."
1332,"EML4-ALK variant 1 containing H-3122 NSCLC cells were treated with second generation ALK inhibitor PF-06463922. PF-06463922 was 125x more potent at reducing cell viability than crizotinib. Control neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type ALK did not show inhibition below 3800 nM with either drug. At values of 10 and 100 nM, PF-06463922 showed increased ability to inhibit ALK 1278 tyrosine phosphorylation in H3122 cells."
1334,"26 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were run on Affymetrix human Exon 1.0 arrays and a computational method that assessed differential 5' and 3' gene expression for each gene was used to find potential rearrangements. One sample showed potential rearrangement and RT-PCR demonstrated an EML4-ALK fusion where EML4 exon 21 was fused to ALK exon 13. This EML4-ALK variant is different from those commonly found in NSCLC. Genomic PCR verified the existence of the fusion breakpoint in intronic space, indicating that some colorectal adenocarcinoma may have targetable ALK-fusion driver mutations."
1335,"84 breast cancer samples acquired from commercial sources were assayed on Affymetrix human exon 1.0 arrays. A computational method was used to find potential gene fusions which assessed differential exon expression between the 3' and 5' ends of each gene. Two potential fusions were found and assessed using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends and RT-PCR. The fusions were EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2. Genomic PCR identified fusion breakpoints, and these differed from breakpoints for these EML4-ALK variants reported in NSCLC."
1336,"The MYCN amplification positive relapsed neuroblastoma-derived cell line CLB-BAR contains the driver ALK DEL 11-14 mutation, which removes extracellular domain exons 4 through 11. Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls. Release of brigatinib administration at day 15 resulted in tumor growth (N=2)."
1338,"A 52 year old male never smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma and was treated with chemotherapy with eventual disease progression. He tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, and started crizotinib with near complete response for 27 months. Progression then occurred and biopsy of a pleural nodule was performed with hybrid-capture NGS. EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation was found with allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity 13%. Due to slow progression and low tumor burden crizotinib was maintained for additional 8 months, and then he was transitioned onto ceritinib at 750 mg daily. After 3 months ceritinib, complete radiographic response was seen and the patient was without evidence of disease at 6 months. Dose was reduced to 600 mg ceritinib daily due to gastrointestinal side effects."
1340,"Ceritinib was 28x more potent (GI50 3.8nM) than crizotinib (GI50 107nM) at inhibiting growth of H2228, an NSCLC cell line which harbors the EML4-ALK variant 3a/3b. SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans."
1341,"The crizotinib-resistant MGH045 cell line with EML4-ALK L1196M was treated with crizotinib or ceritinib. In nude mice with MGH045 xenografts, tumor response to crizotinib did not differ appreciably from vehicle, while ceritinib controlled tumor growth. Ceritinib inhibited Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK L1196M slightly stronger than ALK wild-type, but approximately double the potency as crizotinib, indicating ceritinib sensitivity in Ba/F3 EML4-ALK L1196M cells."
1342,"The NSCLC cell line MGH021-4, harboring SQSTM1-ALK G1269A, was 6 times more sensitive to ceritinib (80nM GI50) than crizotinib (500 nM) in proliferation assays and caused notable reductions in phospho-ALK and phospho-AKT (detected by Western blot) at concentrations 10 fold lower than crizotinib. GI50 values were similar in Ba/F3 cells expressing either EML4-ALK wild-type or EML4-ALK G1269A (1.6nM and 2.2nM, respectively). In contrast, crizotinib treatment of Ba/F3 with EML4-ALK G1269A had survival GI50 of 130nM."
1343,"Ba/F3 cells expressing the EML4-ALK S1206Y variant were treated with ceritinib, and survival GI50 value of 1.5 nM was obtained, which compares favorably with GI50 of 1.7 for the highly ceritinib sensitive EML4-ALK wild-type variant obtained in parallel experiments, as well as the GI50 value of 16 nM obtained for crizotinib treatment of EML4-ALK wild-type."
1344,"Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 3 with ALK I1171T mutation were treated with ceritinib, and survival IC50 of 2.6 nM was observed, which compares favorably with highly ceritinib sensitive EML4-ALK wild-type variant 1 survival IC50 of 1.7 nM reported from parallel experiments. Tumors from mice with EML4-ALK variant 3 H2228 NSCLC cell xenografts which had progressed after approximately 40 days of crizotinib treatment were sequenced for ALK mutations. I1171T was found as one of 6 ALK resistance mutations from 80 sequenced tumors. Treatment of these mouse xenograft models with ceritinib reduced tumor volume to zero, while in contrast tumor size increased with crizotinib treatment."
1349,"Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK 1151 insT were treated with 17-AAG producing an IC50 value of 44.5 nM, which was 0.4 times that reported for EML4-ALK wildtype in Ba/F3, indicating possible increased dependence of EML4-ALK 1151 insT on HSP90. 17-AAG also reduced survival of the parental IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells (183.7 nM), indicating increased nonspecific effects of 17_AAG treatment. Crizotinib resistant clones were produced from the parental EML4-ALK variant 1 containing cell line H3122 (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the EML4-ALK InsT variant. H3122 CR2 and H3122 cells were similarly sensitized to 17-AAG death with an IC50 value of approximately 5 nM, while control cells without EML4-ALK had IC50 values approximately 10x higher."
1352,"The G1202R ALK mutation was found in a crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and the mutant ALK fusion was further characterized in Ba/F3 cells. EML4-ALK variant 1 with G1202R mutation was expressed in Ba/F3 and subject to 17-AAG. IC50 for cell number in response to 17-AAG was 33.4 nM, in contrast to IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, which was 98.9 nM, suggesting sensitization of this variant to HSP90 inhibition."
1353,"EML4-ALK with ALK G1269A has been seen in crizotinib resistant NSCLC, and this mutation was tested for Brigatinib sensitivity via ectopic expression in Ba/F3 cells, where half maximal inhibitory concentration of 9 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 of EML4-ALK wild-type to brigatinib. NPM-ALK G1269A was also tested for brigatinib sensitivity, and IC50 values of 11 nM were reported for both NPM-ALK G1269A and NPM-ALK wild-type. In western blotting, brigatinib at and above 100 nM ablated pALK signal (Y 1604), indicating sensitivity of this variant to brigatinib together with the other results."
1355,"EML4-ALK with G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to ceritinib via transduction into Ba/F3 cells and generation of survival curves varying ceritinib concentration. IC50 of 33 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating sensitivity of the G1269A mutation to ceritinib in the context of EML4-ALK. The mutation was also tested for ceritinib sensitivity in the context of NPM-ALK, where IC50 values were reported of 19 nM and 20 nM for mutant and wild-type versions, respectively, also indicating sensitivity. In western blots, Y1604 pALK levels for wild-type NPM-ALK were ablated at 100 nM, while at 100 nM residual pALK levels were seen in G1269A blotting, with ablation of signal at and above 300 nM, which differed somewhat from the equivalent IC50 values reported for mutant and wild-type in the NPM-ALK background, but still agrees with sensitivity to ceritinib for this mutation."
1356,"In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells."
1360,"Preclinical analysis of the predicitive value of PIK3CA mutations for mTOR/PI3K Inhibition with BEZ-235. Two cell lines with PIK3CA Mutation (H1047R) were more sensitive to BEZ-235 than two cell lines with wild-type PIK3CA (in-vitro, results from one cell line also confirmed in-vivo). Two patient-derived xenografts with PIK3CA mutations (E110K, E542K) showed sensitivity to BEZ-235."
1361,Lentiviral transduction of PIK3CA H1047R mutation into head and neck cancer cell line SCC25 led to increased sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibition with BEZ235 compared to unmanipulated cells (IC50 values 6 nM and 31 nM).
1362,"Two head and neck cancer cell lines with PIK3CA H1047R mutation were more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition with BEZ-235 (NVP-BEZ235, Dactolisib) than two wild type cell lines in vitro. One cell line with H1047R mutation was also found to be sensitive to BEZ-235 in vivo. PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation positive cell lines used were ""CAL-33"" and ""Detroit 562"". Wild type cell lines used here were ""SCC-9"" and ""PE/CA-PJ34(clone C12)""."
1363,"Xenografts from one head and neck cancer cell line (CAL-33) with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation were more sensitive to the combined inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and EGFR with BEZ-235 and cetuximab (N=9) than cetuximab (N=9, P=0.0039) or BEZ-235 alone (N=9, P=0.0002) in-vivo."
1365,"In a phase 2 clinical trial of sorafenib in patients with hereditary or sporadic advanced medullary thyroid cancer, 10 out of 12 patients genotyped in arm B (sporadic MTC) tested positive for RET mutations. In response to sorafenib, 8 patients with RET M918T mutations had stable disease, 1 RET M918T mutant had partial response, and 1 patient with a RET C634R mutation had stable disease. Prior to study entry, all patients with RET M918T mutations had progressive disease or were newly diagnosed."
1366,"In a phase 2 clinical trial, NCT01209598, 30 patients with CDK4-amplified and RB-expressing well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WDLS/DDLS) were treated with a selective CDK 4/6 inhibitor, PD0332991. Treatment with PD0332991 was associated with favorable progression free survival rates (66% PFS rate, primary end point being greater than 40%) suggesting that CDK4 amplification is predictive of sensitivity to CDK4 inhibitor therapy."
1368,"A 51 year old female never smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with liver metastases, and had adverse response to crizotinib treatment, after which she responded to alectinib until disease progressed after 5 months with new liver metastases. Liver tumor biopsy was taken and estimated to be 15% tumor. Hybrid capture next generation sequencing was performed and an I1171N mutation was found in rearranged ALK, and estimated to be in 33% of the tumor cells. Ceritinib was given at 750 mg once daily but dose reduction to 600 mg once daily was required due to persistent nausea. CT showed regression of liver lesions and primary lung lesion and ongoing response was seen at 3 months."
1370,"In this phase 1 trial, 60 patients with advanced solid tumors (ovarian, breast, colorectal, melanoma, sarcoma, prostate) were treated with PARP inhibitor olaparib. Durable antitumor activity was only observed in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. 19 BRCA carriers had ovarian, breast, or prostate cancers; 12 of these (63%) had a clinical benefit from treatment with olaparib: radiologic or tumor-marker responses or meaningful disease stabilization (stable disease for a period of 4 months or more). Nine BRCA carriers had a response according to RECIST, with the response sustained for more than 76 weeks in one patient. No responses were seen in patients without BRCA mutation."

1372,"Preclinical study in 9 melanoma cell lines. Three cell lines did not have CDKN2A (p16) mutations and showed expression of the protein on western blot analysis. Two of the other six cell lines had stop codons leading to a truncated protein, and three had missense mutations with evidence of protein expression on western blot (two cell lines with a P114L mutation and one with an E88K mutation). Mean IC50s of flavopiridol were significantly lower in cell lines with a mutated or non-expressed p16 (p16-) (mean 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 12.5 nM), than in cell lines with intact p16 (p16+) (mean IC(50) = 25 nM)."

PD0332991 efficacy (proliferation assay) was assessed in a panel of 47 melanoma cell lines. Loss of functional p16INK4A (CDKN2A) due to gene deletion (49% of cells), methylation (4% of cells), or mutation (19% of cells) was the most prevalent alteration occurring in 71% of cell lines, and significantly correlated with PD0332991 sensitivity (Fisher's exact test P < 0.02)."
1376,"In a cohort of 143 patients with primary invasive melanoma, copy-number gain of CDK4 was observed (FISH) in 37% of cases.

Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of PD-0332991 were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb-proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were significantly more sensitive to PD-0332991 (as defined by IC50 < mean) in mRNA expression (Agilent), protein level (Western Blot) and copy number (Array CGH) analyses."
1380,"The HER2/Neu mammary tumor mouse model MMTV-NeuT was employed to demonstrate dependence of HER2 tumor formation on PIK3 p110alpha isoform. MMTV-NeuT mice were crossed with floxed p110alpha mice. Diassacociated tumors cells from these mice were treated with Cre adenovirus to delete p110alpha, or GFP adenovirus, and cells were transplanted into athymic mice. GFP treated cells formed new tumors, while p110alpha deletion blocked tumor formation indicating tumor dependence on PI3KA. Next, MMTV-NeuT tumors were dissociated and treated with pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Reduced lipid kinase activity and reduced phospho-Akt levels were seen in these cells. Administration of 125 mg/kg GDC-0941 to athymic mice with transplantation of tumor cells caused marked reduction of tumor cell volume in comparison to control treatment."
1381,"Pharmacologic (A66; p110alpha specific inhibitor) or genetic (cre-mediated knockout) ablation of the p110alpha PI3K isoform reduced tumor growth and tumor formation, respectively, in athymic mice transplanted with cells transduced by MMTV-NeuT (mammary specific overexpression of HER2 that effectively induces tumors). A66 treatment of cells from MMTV-NeuT mouse tumors resulted in decreased lipid kinase activity and phospho Akt levels."

Furthermore, 91% of these patients were estimated to remain in response at 1 year (95% CI, Kaplan-Meier analysis)."
1394,A patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma was found to harbor EGFR T790M and S768I mutations when acquired resistance developed after 8 years of erlotinib treatment. Analysis of original tumor samples from 2001 and 2003 were found to also harbor the S768I (but not T790M) mutation. Three-dimensional visualization showed the 768 position to be outside of the erlotinib binding position.

BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was then administered at 960 mg twice daily and later at 720 mg twice daily and reduction in metastases was observed. After 2 years complete radiological response was seen, while treatment was discontinued due to cardiomyopathy. 12 months after stopping vemurafenib patient did not show evidence of metastatic melanoma."
1401,"In a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines, 2 lines containing the PIK3CA mutation H1047R (Detroit562 and SNU-1076) were more sensitive to growth inhibition (IC50 1.10 and 6.82) by the PI3Kalpha specific inhibitor BYL719 (Alepelisib) than 3 of 4 lines with wild type PI3K (SNU-1066 IC50 1.13 μM; SNU-1041, 20.65 μM; FaDu, 19.67 μM; SCC25, 49.30 μM).

In the PIK3CA wild type subroup of cell lines, 22% were assessed as responsive, while in the subgroup of cell lines with PIK3CA mutations, 64% were labeled as responders. 7 patient derived xenografts with PIK3CA mutations (H1047R, E545K, M1043I, C420R, Q546K) were transplanted into mice and treated with BYL719. 6/7 mice responded with strong tumor growth inhibition or regression, while one (H1047R) responded with weak growth inhibition."
1403,474 cancer cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia were assessed for response to the PI3Kalpha inhibitor BYL719 (Alpelisib). PIK3CA amplification was significanly associated with BYL719 response. A gastric cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) was transplanted into two athymic mice and one was treated with BYL719. The untreated PDX grew by over 100 percent while the BYL719 tumor was reduced by 86 percent.
1407,"In the NCT00880321 trial using mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in solid tumors, 10 cases of melanoma brain metastases were assessed for dabrafenib response. In nine patients a decrease in size of metastases was seen, and in four cases a complete resolution of brain lesions was observed. This subset of patients had median progression free survival of 4.2 months."
1408,"5 of 7 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation were resistant to treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. An RNAi screen in the WiDr cell line (a V600E CRC line) identified EGFR as an enhancer for survival when exposed to vemurafenib. Treatment with vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab or gefitinib) in V600E CRC cells (WiDr, VACO432 and KM20) showed inhibited growth as well as induction of the cleaved PARP apoptotic marker. WiDr and VACO432 cells were injected into immunodeficient mice. Modest response was seen with vemurafenib treatment, while combination treatment showed considerable tumor growth inhibition as compared to control."
1409,"Phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. A relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression was observed with vemurafenib as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons)."
1410,"Phase 2 trial in 132 patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation. Confirmed overall response rate was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 62; 6% with a complete response and 47% with a partial response), median duration of response was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.6), and median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.1). Median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 18.3)."
1411,"The Combi-v (NCT01597908) open-label, randomized phase 3 trial had 704 patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Patients were randomized to receive either a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib orally as first-line therapy. At preplanned interim analysis the overall survival rate at 12 months was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 77) in the combination-therapy group and 65% (95% CI, 59 to 70) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the combination-therapy group and 7.3 months in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.69; P<0.001). Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma occurred at 1% with combination-therapy and 18% in the vemurafenib group."
1414,"A 73 year old patient with prior history of breast cancer presented with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. After two treatments of I-131 a comprehensive tumor profile revealed BRAF V600E as the only genetic alteration on a near diploid genome with trisomy 1q. Vemurafenib treatment resulted in improvement of symptoms and considerable reductions in tumor mass, and after 23 months the patient remained on therapy with well controlled disease."
1415,"In clinical trial NCT01072175, 43 patients with BRAF V600 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) received mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib. Only 12% of patients showed partial response or better, with one complete response lasting 36 months and ongoing after data cutoff. 56% of patients achieved stable disease. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, longer than the median PFS (2.5 months) reported for metastatic CRC treated with standard chemotherapy. The authors conclude that MAPK targeting in CRC is a valid approach that can produce meaningful responses but additional work is required to more effectively inhibit the pathway."
1417,"Mutations in SF3B1 were identified in 21/936 ER positive vs. 1/289 ER negative breast cancers. Mutation was recurrent (K700E in 74% or K666Q or K666E in another 9% of tumors). Treatment of two SF3B1 mutant cell lines (pancreatic and endometrial with K700 and K666 mutation, respectively) and six wild-type controls showed that mutant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to spliceostatin A (SF3b complex inhibitor)."

Treatment of two SF3B1 mutant cell lines (pancreatic and endometrial with K700 and K666 mutation, respectively) and six wild-type controls showed that mutant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to spliceostatin A (SF3b complex inhibitor)."
1419,"In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients)."
1421,"In this Phase III trial (coBRIM, NCT01689519) of 495 V600 mutant melanoma patients, 344 had V600E mutation. 174 patients were treated with vemurafenib and placebo, and 170 were treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib and tested for progression free survival. 88 of 174 monotherapy group patients had an event with median progression free survival of 6.5 months. In the combination group 58 of 174 patients had an event with median progression-free survival not met, however, when in combination with other V600 mutations median progression-free survival was 9.9 months with combination treatment. Median time to followup for the whole cohort was 7.3 months. Hazard Ratio for progression or death was 0.57 (0.41-0.80)."
1422,"In a randomized phase 3 study, previously untreated advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma patients treated with combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib showed improved progression free survival (9.9 vs 6.2 months), increased rate of complete or partial response (68% vs 45%), and improved overall survival at 9 months ( 81% vs 73%) compared to the vemurafenib and placebo control group."
1423,"In 5 patients with KIT M541L mutation-positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia (4 somatic and 1 germline mutation), treatment with low dose imatinib resulted in complete and lasting remission with a median follow up of 74 months and 1 patient relapse at 50 months."
1424,"In a study of 78 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with sunitinib, patients with Kit exon 9 mutations or wildtype (lacking KIT or PDGFRA mutations) showed increased progression free survival and overall survival compared to patients with Kit exon 11 mutations."
1428,"In a mouse model of BRAF V600E colorectal cancer, western blots from tumors in mice treated with BRAF inhibitor GDC-0879 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 showed stronger reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 than PI3K/mTOR inhibitor alone, and combination inhibition also resulted in stronger phospho-ERK inhibition in tumors than did BRAF inhibition alone. Increased apoptosis in tumors was seen in dual treatment conditions with increased TUNEL-positive cells. In vehicle treated mice, area of colon covered by tumor increased, while treatment with single agent inhibitors caused growth inhibition resulting in no change in colon area covered by tumors. Administration of dual inhibitors induced tumor regression apparent in a decrease of colonic area covered by tumors over the course of treatment."
1429,"In six NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, concomitant use of MEK inhibitor and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor resulted in greater decrease in cell viability than either alone, with the synergistic effect being marked in 4/6 cell lines. MEK inhibitor JTP-74057 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458 together induced synergistic increase in apoptotic Annexin V+/PI+ cells in these cell lines. Tumor xenografts in nude mice were established with 5 of the 6 cell lines. Effects of single agent treatment with JTP-74057 or GSK2126458 ranged from minor inhibition to tumor stasis, while dual inhibitor treatment showed synergistic effects in each case, with marked tumor reductions in 2/5 cases and the authors report one compete response in a MaMel301 cell line xenograft mouse."
1430,"BRAF mutations were identified in 9% of 108 cases of high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors (80% V600E). Two patients were treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition and exhibited durable response (beyond 7 and 9 months, respectively). Urinary BRAF V600E tumor DNA correlated with disease response in one of the patients. BRAF and MEK inhibition was either dabrafenib+trametinib (case 1) or vemurafenib+trametinib (case 2)."
1432,"In a randomized phase II study, first line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) resulted in improved progression free survival and fewer serious adverse effects when compared to treatment with combination trastuzumab plus docetaxel (HT) (median follow up 14 months, median PFS with T-DM1 14.2 vs 9.2 with HT)."
1437,"In a randomized phase 3 trial, HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients given first-line treatment of pertuzumab plus trastuzumb plus docetaxel experienced improved progression free survival (18.5 vs 12.4 months, P<0.001) and increased objective response rate (80.2% vs 69.3%, P=0.001) than the control group given placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel."
1438,"A phase 1 clinical trial identified a patient with chemotherapy-refractory urothelial carcinoma who had complete radiographic response lasting 14 months after combined everolimus and pazopanib treatment. This patient was exome sequenced and two mutations co-occurring in MTOR were identified. Expression of these mutations in HEK293T cells demonstrated these were activating mutations. The authors propose that these two activating mutations are the reason for the dramatic response to mTOR inhibition and considered them as ""biologically plausible"" to confer sensitivity to everolimus."
1439,"In a randomized open label phase 3 study (NCT00553358), women with HER2 positive primary breast cancer treated with lapatinib plus trasuzumab had higher rates of pathological complete responses than seen in control groups receiving either IV trastuzumab or oral lapatinib alone (combination treatment pCR rate of 51% vs 29.5% and 24.7% for trastuzumab and lapatinib alone, respectively)."
1440,Study describes an 18 year old never smoker patient presenting with lung adenocarcinoma. A genomic profiling assay (FoundationOne) revealed a 7-copy amplification of RICTOR as the only somatic alteration. RICTOR amplification was confirmed via FISH and IHC. On two separate treatments with dual mTOR1/2 inhibitors patient exhibited stable disease for more than 18 months.
1441,A cohort of seven male patients with myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome and elevated serum tryptase levels were enrolled in a study of imatinib mesylate therapy. All seven patients demonstrated improvement in clinical symptoms and resolution of laboratory abnormalities and bone marrow pathology in response to treatment. Complete molecular remission of FIP1L1-PDGFRA was observed in 5 of 6 patients tested post-therapy.
1443,"Study describes a 31-year old male, never-smoker patient with advanced NSCLC. Testing did not indicate tumor had EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement. First line erlotininb did not yield a response. After worsening symptoms including hypoxia, testing yielded a ROS1 rearrangement. The patient was treated with crizotinib with marked response at 1 week, resolution of hypoxia at 2 weeks, and resolution of the tumor confirmed at 8 and 12 weeks via CT-scans. It was also demonstrated that crizotinib inhibits ROS1 phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells transfected with a CD74::ROS1 fusion gene, and crizotinib inhibited growth in the HCC78 cell line containing a ROS1 rearrangement to a similar degree as ALK-fusion positive cell lines."
1444,Case report of a pediatric patient with treatment-refactory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor negative for ALK expression and rearrangement. Next generation sequencing of the patient revealed a TFG-ROS1 fusion. CT scans after 3 cycles of crizotinib treatment showed a reduction of the tumor mass which continued to decrease at the time of publication after 4 months of crizonitib treatment.
1445,"Of eleven patients prospectively accrued with hypereosinophilic syndrome, nine had favorable responses to imatinib that lasted >3 months post-treatment. Of these nine patients, five were found to have a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion."
1447,"Doxycycline dependent expression of the PIK3CA H1047R mutation in mouse type II alveolar epithelial cells drove lung cancer in a reversible fashion, indicating the driver properties of this p110alpha catalytic domain mutation. Administration of pan-p110 isoform and mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 to H1047R mice with established tumors resulted in reduced tumor phospho-Akt and phosoho-S6 levels, and significant regression of tumor volume."
1448,"In 5 trastuzumab resistant HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, combination of the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147 (pilaralisib) and trastuzumab treatment induced cell death to similar or greater levels than XL147 alone. In three trastuzumab resistant cell lines tested, colony formation in matrigel was markedly inhibited by combination treatment. Apoptotic markers were apparent with combination treatment. In athymic mice, trastuzumab resistant cell line HR6 was used in tumor xenografts and tumors were allowed to form. Mice subsequently treated with trastuzumab or XL147 showed continued tumor growth without marked difference from control, while combination treatment essentially halted tumor growth rate."
1454,"Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. Inactivity of BRAF as mediated by specific mutation (D594A, D594V or K483M) or selective pharmacological inhibition leads to MEK hyperactivation through CRAF binding in NRAS mutant D04 cells. Either pan-RAF (e.g. sorafenib in the abscence of CRAF T421N gatekeeper mutation) or MEK inhibitors (e.g., trametinib) could instead block ERK pathway hyperactivation in RAS mutated cancers."
1455,"Knockdown of PTEN in trastuzumab sensitive HER2 breast cancer BT474 cells induced trastuzumab resistance. PTEN null cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also did not show substantial inhibition, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and LY294002 induced growth inhibition comparable to trastuzumab alone in normal BT474 cells. BT474 mouse xenograft tumors were injected with PTEN antisense (AS) oligonucleotides and this resulted in trastuzumab resitance. Co-treatment of PTEN AS tumor mice with LY294002 and trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth in comparison to PTEN AS tumors treated with trastuzumab or LY294002 alone."

1460,Case report of a 69 year old patient with metastatic melanoma treated with MEK inhibitor TAK-733 in a clinical trial. A partial radiographic response with a decrease of 31% in the sum of maximum diameters of target metastatic lesions in the liver and spleen was noted after 2 cycles of therapy and remained progression free at more than 24 weeks. Follow-up sequencing analysis of DNA from the patient's tumor revealed a somatic BRAF L597S mutation.
1461,"Preclinical study in 293H cell line. Ectopic expression of V600E, L597R/Q/S, and K601E mutants elevated phospho-MEK and ERK levels.

1463,Case report of a phase 1 study in advanced melanoma patients. 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled and treated with trametinib. One patient with a BRAF Leu597Val had a confirmed partial response with 60% tumour reduction and received study treatment for more than 2 years.
1464,"The HNSCC cell line LB771 with PIK3CA amplification was shown to have low antiproliferative IC50 for the p110beta-sparing PI3K inhibitor taselisib. Under increasing taselisib concentrations, reduction in phospho-Akt pro-survival signal was apparent, along with increased levels of pro-apoptotic marker cleaved PARP. A general tendency for taselisib sensitivity to PI3K activation (mutation/amplification) was also seen in a panel of 26 HNSCC cell lines"
1465,"The Cal-33 HNSCC cell line with H1047R mutation was found to have a low antiproliferative IC50 value for the alpha, gamma and delta isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor taselisib. Increasing taselisib concentration induced reduction of phospho-Akt levels in Call-33 cells, while upregulating the cleaved PARP apoptotic marker. Among a panel of 26 HNSCC cell lines, activating PI3K mutations were associated with taselisib sensitivity in comparison to wild-type PI3K or PTEN mutant cell lines."
1469,"Preclinical study of mouse melanoma both in-vitro and in-vivo. Braf/Nf1-mutant melanomas were less sensitive to vemurafenib than the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. mTOR inhibition with rapamycin had a more pronounced effect than GDC-0941 on mouse melanoma, but synergized with PD0325901(but not vemurafenib) to promote tumor regression."
1471,"NF1 was identified in an unbiased RNAi screen as mediator of resistance to BRAF inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma. BRAF V600E/NF1 mutant cell lines were sensitive to ERK inhibition with VTX-11e, modest resistance was observed against RAF inhibitor AZ628. Combined PLX4720 and AZD6244 (selumetinib) achieved greater efficacy than either agent alone but NF1 knockdown was still associated with residual resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro."
1472,Phase II study in 71 patients with NRAS or BRAF V600 mutant melanoma treated with MEK162. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed).
1473,Phase 1 trial in 57 patients with advanced cancers treated with selumetinib. 4 melanoma patients had NRAS Q61 mutations. One patient with NRAS mutation had 70% tumor shrinkage after three cycles of selumetinib (AZD6244) but developed symptomatic brain metastases before confirmatory scans could be performed.
1475,"Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. NRAS Q61K, in addition to the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with resistance to vemurafenib but sensitivity to AZD6244 (selumetinib) in vitro in the acquired resistant cell line M249-AR4 and in the patient-derived acquired resistant cell line M376."
1476,"Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. Cell lines (2-5/assay) with NRAS mutation were more sensitive to Amuvatinib (inhibitor targets multiple tyrosine kinases) than BRAF mutant cell lines in growth inhibition, tyrosine phosphorylation inhibition, cell cycle and apoptotic (Annexin V) assays."
1481,"Thirty-six patients with CLL were treated with alemtuzumab. Partial or complete response was achieved in 6 of 15 patients with p53 mutations, compared to 4 of 21 without. These findings are not statistically significant, but the authors suggest that alemtuzumab is an effective therapy for patients with p53 mutations or deletions."
1482,"Study explored the hematologic and molecular responses in a cohort of 31 patients presenting with thrombocythemia and CALR exon 9 frameshift mutations. All 31 patients exhibited a hematologic response at the time of followup (European LeukemiaNet criteria). In regards to molecular response, before treatment the CALR mutant allele displayed a median frequency of 41% across the cohort, during treatment a significant decrease was observed in comparison to controls treated with hydroxyurea and aspirin."
1490,"A panel of 26 HNSCC cell lines was tested for efficacy of the p110 alpha, delta and gamma isoform inhibitor taselisib (GDC-0032). Cell lines with PIK3CA mutation or amplification were the most sensitive. Four HNSCC cell lines with activating PIK3CA alterations showed synergistic cell death response to the combination of drug with radiation treatment. This synergism was not apparent in 4 tested HNSCC cell lines with wild-type PIK3CA or PTEN mutation. Nude mouse xenografts were established with Cal-33 PIK3CA H1047R cells. Radiation and taselisib treatments alone showed some growth inhibition in comparison to control, but only the combined treatment led durable tumor regressions."
1491,"IC50 for the pan-Akt inhibitor ipatasertib (GDC-0068) was determined over a panel of 100 cancer cell lines. Loss or mutation of PTEN (e.g. PTEN deletion, T319fsX1/Y155C, etc.) was significantly associated with ipatasertib sensitivity (p=0.000071). Non-transformed human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells were compared to an isogenic line with PTEN knockout. With low or high EGF culture conditions, a 4x or 3.5x decrease in IC50 for ipatasertib was seen in PTEN knockout cells, respectively."
1494,Preclinical study in melanoma cell lines. EZH2 expression was higher in EZH2 mutant (N=3) and wild-type melanoma cell lines (N=12) than untransformed cells (human epithelial melanocytes and human dermal fibroblasts). EZH2 mutant cell lines were the most sensitive to GSK126 compared to wild-type and untransformed.

1498,"Twelve patients with BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disease and reciprocal translocations involving PDGFRB received imatinib for a median of 47 months (range, 0.1-60 months). Eleven had prompt responses, 10 had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Updates were sought from 8 further patients previously described in the literature; prompt responses were described in 7 and persist in 6."
1499,"ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive (overexpression or amplification) advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice. Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer. Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone). The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer."
1500,"A patient derived mouse xenograft model was established with gastric cancer cells having PTEN loss. The xenograft was resistant to monotherapy with both the pan-Akt inhibitor AZD5363, and also to the commonly used gastric cancer chemotheraputic docetaxel. When used in combination, AZD5363 and docetaxel induced significant tumor growth inhibition in comparison to monotherapy and vehicle control."
1501,"In a panel of 22 gastric cancer cell lines, 4 of 6 cell lines having the highest sensitivity to AZD5363 contained a PIK3CA mutation (E542K, E453K, E545K). A patient derived gastric cancer xenograft mouse model was established with PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells, and treatment with AZD5363 induced significant tumor growth inhibition in comparison to vehicle control."
1502,"In a panel of 182 cell lines (162 with PIK3CA mutation status known) from solid and hematological tumors, significant correlation was found between AZD5363 (pan-Akt inhibitor) sensitivity and PIK3CA mutation status (N=33, p=0.0059). In the subpopulation free of RAS mutation (N=19) the correlation was increased."
1503,"Sensitivity to pan-Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was assessed in a panel of 182 cell lines (160 with PTEN evaluated) derived from solid and hematological tumors. PTEN loss of function due to loss or mutation (N=32) was found to be significantly correlated with AZD5363 sensitivity (p=0.0099), and correlation improved in the subpopulation free of RAS mutation. Mouse xenografts with 786-0 (PTEN-null renal cancer) cells were established. 75 mg/kg twice daily AZD5363 caused tumor growth inhibition while 150 mg/kg twice daily induced moderate tumor regression."
1504,"HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines with PIK3CA mutation BT474c (K111N) and HCC-1954 (H1047R) were used to establish mouse tumor xenografts. In BT474c xenografts, three dosing schedules of AZD5363 caused significant tumor inhibition (200 mg/kg twice daily > 200 mg/kg once daily > 100 mg/kg once daily). In HCC-1954 xenografts two doses of AZD5363 induced significant tumor inhibition (150 mg/kg twice daily > 75 mg/kg twice daily) while 30 mg/kg twice weekly trastuzumab was inactive."
1505,"Tumor xenografts in mice were established with the KPL4 HER2 positive breast cancer cell line with PIK3CA H1047R mutation. KPL4 has suboptimal responses to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Xengraft treatment with trastuzumab and AZD5363 monotherapy induced moderate growth inhibition which was significant for AZD5363, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and AZD5363 induced significant tumor regression and enhanced growth delay upon removal of treatment."
1506,"The HER2 breast cancer cell line KPL4 with PIK3CA H1047R shows sub-optimal responses to trastuzumab and lapatinib, and was used to establish mouse xenografts. Treatment of mice with monotherapy of AZD5363 or lapatinib alone induced growth inhibition (37%, not significant; 65%, P = 0.004), but treatment with AZD5363 and lapatinib together induced significant tumor regression (109%, P < 0.0001) as well as delayed tumor regrowth after removal of therapy."
1509,"In a panel of 7 NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, all 7 were found to be sensitive to the MEK inhibitor MEK162, whereas 3 of 5 melanoma cell lines that were wild type for BRAF and NRAS were not sensitive to MEK162. In further tests using two of the seven NRAS mutant cell lines (YUDOSO Q16K/wt and YUKIM Q16R), colony forming capacity was reduced with increased MEK162 treatment, and MEK162 induced apoptotic markers in these cells."
1517,"Trial NCT00730639 tested monoclonal antibody nivolumab against the PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor in pretreated patients with various cancer types. PD-L1 expression was tested in 42 patients by ICH from tumor FFPE biopsies. (18 melanoma, 10 NSCLC, 7 colorectal cancer, 5 renal cell cancer, 2 prostate cancer). 9 of 25 PD-L1 expressing patients showed objective response, and zero of 17 PD-L1 negative patients showed objective response (p=0.006). Biopsies were optional, and therefore not fully randomized."
1518,"A 78-year-old man presented with oral papillary adenocarcinoma and lung metastases that were refractory to standard treatment. Tumor sequencing showed increased MAPK activity due to RET over-expression and PTEN deletion, therefore sunitinib (RET inhibitor) was initiated. After 28 days post-administration, the lung metastases decreased in size by 22% (28mm to 21mm) and no new metastatic lesions had appeared. After 4 months, the patient grew resistant to treatment."
1519,"A 39-year old woman who presented with acute myeloid leukemia revealed a complicated genetic profile using conventional metaphase cytogenetics and FISH analysis. Whole genome sequencing elucidated a PML-RARA fusion, which can be successfully treated with ATRA. Uncovering this mutation prevented an unnecessary allogeneic transplant and the patient remained in remission 15 months post-treatment (date of publication)."
1520,"A 67-year-old Caucasian female with stage IVA Sezary syndrome presented refractory to traditional therapy and was enrolled in a whole genome study trial. Sequencing revealed a CTLA4-CD28 fusion protein such that the inhibitory CTLA4 receptor activated a stimulatory CD28 intracellular domain that promoted proliferation. The patient was treated with iplimumab, a CTLA4 receptor inhibitor, and after 10 days, there was a reduction in erythema and ulceration by 50%, a reduction in tumor size by 75%, and overall improved quality of life. However, during the sixth week of therapy, the patient rapidly developed skin tumors and died 3 months later."
1522,"Castrated mice bearing androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinomas (LNCaP tumors) were treated with PI3K inhibitors (AZD8186, BYL719) and an androgen receptor inhibitor (MDV3100). Mice treated with single therapy of either MDV3100, BYL719, or AZD8186 resulted in mild tumor growth inhibition of 90%, 36%, and 40% respectively (n=5 mice/group). However, triple therapy of MDV300, BYL719, and AZD8186 resulted in tumor regression of 113% (n=5 mice)."
1525,"In an evaluation of 96 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, 31 were responsive to LGK974 (PORCN inhibitor). Of 40 cell lines (25 responsive, 15 non-responsive) that were exome sequenced, 6 cell lines had NOTCH1 loss-of-function mutations (N-terminal frameshift/nonsense) and 5/6 cell lines that had NOTCH1 mutations were susceptible to LGK974 (PORCN inhibitor)."
1527,"Four fulvestrant (estrogen receptor degrader) resistant cell lines were derived from parent fulvestrant sensitive ER+ MCF-7/SO.5 breast cancer cell line. Derivative cell lines showed some sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and increased growth inhibition when treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib together."
1528,"A 25-year-old Caucasian male presented with a second relapse of B-ALL. RNA sequencing revealed FLT3 overexpression (also confirmed by IHC). The patient was treated with 22 days of sunitinib, permitting the patient to undergo a bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow biopsy showed complete clearance by variant allele frequency and the patient remains in remission 4-years post matched-unrelated donor allograft."
1529,"In a study of ovarian carcinomas, 81% of tumors with germline BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive, whereas only 60% of tumors with non-BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive (N=47; N=158; P=0.01). Sensitivity was defined by maintenance of complete response greater than 6 months post platinum-based therapy."
1530,"In a study of ovarian carcinomas, 81% of tumors with germline BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive, whereas only 60% of tumors with non-BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive (N=47; N=158; P=0.01). Sensitivity was defined by maintenance of complete response greater than 6 months post platinum-based therapy."
1531,"In a study of ovarian carcinomas, 87% of tumors with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive, whereas only 60% of tumors with non-BRCA1/2 mutations were platinum sensitive (N=38; N=158; P=0.002).

Sensitivity to platinum was defined by maintenance of complete response greater than 6 months post platinum therapy."
1534,"A 26-year old patient presented with vemurafenib resistant BRAF V600E-mutated cutaneous melanoma. Five metastases were evaluated using whole genome sequencing and a 4-bp deletion in PTEN (frameshift mutation at V317) was identified as unanimously present in all five tumors and a pre-treatment biopsy. The other copy of PTEN was lost with a chromosome-wide loss of chr 10. Subsequently, a patient-derived tumor cell line (designated 22 092) was suspended in a solution of PD184352/MK2206 combination therapy and cell growth inhibition confirmed tumor sensitivity to MEK/AKT inhibitors compared to the BRAF V600E-containing A375P cell line. ERK inhibitor resistance was demonstrated as a result of a GNAQ Q209P mutation also identified in the patient. This cell line showed overexpression of AKT and no expression of PTEN."
1541,"A phase 2 clinical trial evaluated 165 patients with oestrogen receptor positive and HER2-negative breast cancer such that 84 patients received combination therapy of palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 patients received letrozole alone. The combination therapy arm had higher median duration of progression-free survival when compared to the letrozole only group (20.2 months vs. 10.2 months; p<0.0004). A subcategory of patients taking combination therapy, who lacked mutations in p16 or CCND1 (n=34), had an even higher median free survival of 26.1 months. Noticeable side effects in the combination therapy group included neutropenia (54%) leucopenia (19%), fatigue (4%) back pain (2%), diarrhea (2%) and pulmonary embolism (4%)."
1549,"Phase 1 study with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor apitolisib. 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70mg. Of the 14 evaluable patients with PIK3CA mutations total, there were 3 PRs (1 confirmed), 8 SD, and 3 PD as best radiological responses. One of the partial responses harbored a PIK3CA E542K mutation."
1550,"Phase 1 study with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor apitolisib. 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70mg. Of 45 evaluable patients receiving 40mg, two patients with E545K PIK3CA mutation (one head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient and a patient with ovarian cancer) had unconfirmed partial responses. Of the 14 evaluable patients with PIK3CA mutations total, there were 3 PRs (1 confirmed), 8 SD, and 3 PD as best radiological responses."
1555,"Six children with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML received initial therapy with sorafenib (alone or in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine). Four of the patients initially achieved morphological complete remission (bone marrow blasts <5%), however, 3 patients developed resistance within 14-37 weeks and and 1 required a bone marrow transplant. Two patients did not have any clinical response to sorafenib upon initial treatment."
1561,"In a panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines, HER2 overexpressing cells were among those more sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). In the trastuzumab sensitive cell line Bt474, palbociclib synergized with trastuzumab in growth inhibition, while in 2 trastuzumab resistant cell lines, addition of trastuzumab to palbociclib treatment resulted in increased growth inhibition over palbociclib alone."
1562,"A panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines was tested for sensitivty/resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991), where IC50 below 150nM was sensitive, and above 1000nM resistant. Cyclin D1 had higher expression levels in sensitive cell lines."
1563,"In Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), t(11:14)-induced overexpression of cyclin D1 was targeted by CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib (PD0332991). Palbociclib caused Rb dephosphorylation in MCL cell lines and patient derived tumor cells. MCL cell lines overexpressing cyclin D1 showed growth inhibition with Palbociclib. The VAL DLBCL cell line was used as control to verify cyclin D1 overexpression but was not used as a control in Palbociclib inhibitor experiments. Instead, the investigators report that other publications report cell lines without cyclin D1 overexpression had higher IC50 values for palbociclib, suggesting overexpresssed cyclin D1 targetability in MCL."
1565,"A 62 year old female was diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) WHO grade 4. Treatment included radiation, temozolomide and cediranib. MET amplification was found by FISH, and ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib treatment was started. A 40% reduction in size of contrast enhancing lesion was seen. After 6 months, progressive disease was seen and crizotinib withdrawn. The authors state this is a first report of response to prospective MET targeted therapy in GBM."
1566,"2 MET amplified NSCLC cell lines (EBC-1 and H1993), as well as 2 EGFR mutant and 2 MET and EGFR wild type cell lines were treated with ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib, and the MET amplified cells had IC50 100 fold lower than the non MET amplified cell lines. Both crizotinib treatment and siRNA against MET increased apoptotic markers in MET amplified cells but not controls, indicating that crizotinib targeting of amplified MET was inducing the apoptotic effects. Tumors caused by MET amplified EBC-1 cells injected into mice were significantly inhibited with crizotinib treatment, while tumors from non-MET amplified cells showed no substantial effect."
1570,"Case report of a 47year old female patient with metastatic melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, KIT negative). A PPFIBP2-BRAF fusion was identified from DNA from a brain metastasis (inton 3 of PPFIBP2 fused to intron 10 of BRAF). Trametinib was introduced and anemia and ECOG status improved. Imaging revealed a 90% decrease in extracranial and 19% decrease in intracranial metastases with no new metastases and no progressing sites at 6 weeks. Trametinib was stopped and pembrolizumab introduced at this time. Progressive disease was noted after 5 cycles of pembrolizumab but re-introduction of trametinib did not show an effect."
1571,"A 65 yr old male patient with metastatic acral lentiginous melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, KIT negative) was found to harbor a KIAA1549-BRAF (intron 15-intron 8) fusion in a subcutaneous metastasis sample after disease progression. Trametinib was started and fatigue and ECOG status improved but imaging revealed slight disease progression after 2 weeks (15 sites measurable, 9 stable, 6 progressive). No new metastases were identified. The patient was switched to pembrolizumab and major disease progression was noted."
1572,"Patients with refractory colorectal cancer expressing immunohistochemically detectable EGFR were randomly assigned to receive treatment with cetuximab (n=287) or receive supportive care alone (n=285). Patients receiving cetuximab had increased overall survival (HR=0.77, 95%CI 0.64-0.92; p=0.005), increased progression-free survival (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.57-0.80; p<0.001), and improved quality of life at 4 months measured by survey on physical deterioration (-5.9 vs -12.5; p=0.03) and global health status (-3.6 vs. -15.2; p<0.001)."
1574,"Patients with BRAF-V600 mutated cancers were identified (n=122) and clinical response to vemurafenib was evaluated. Of the 20 patients with non-small-cell-lung cancer (17 with BRAF V600E, one with BRAF V600G and one with BRAF V600 unknown status), 19 were evaluable and the response rate to vemurafenib was 42%, tumor regression was observed in 14/19 patients, progression-free survival was 7.3 months, and 12-month overall survival was 66%."
1575,"Patients with BRAF-V600 mutated cancers were identified (n=122) and clinical response to vemurafenib was evaluated. Of the 14 patients with Langerhans’-cell histiocytosis, 43% of patients had a response to vemurafenib (1 complete and 5 partial responses), disease regression was observed in 12/14 patients, all patients detailed improvement in disease-related symptoms, 0 patients had progressive disease during treatment, 12-month progression free survival was 91%, and overall survival rate was 100%. Among all 18 patients with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans histiocytosis, 94% had BRAF V600E mutations and the remaining 6 percent (1 patient) had an unknown V600 mutation."
1577,"A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer. The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174). In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54). Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001)."
1579,"Two clinical trials evaluated the effects of vemurafenib in 54 patients with BRAF (V600E) positive hairy-cell leukemia. The overall response rate was 98% with 19/54 having a complete response and 34/54 having a partial response. In the Italian study (n=25), the median relapse-free survival was 9 months and in the U.S. study (n=24), rate of progression-free survival was 73% with overall survival rate of 91%."
1583,"c-MET and ligand HGF were expressed by 6 uveal melanoma cell lines in-vitro. GNA-mutant cell lines (n=3) showed stronger expression of ligand and receptor as well as more receptor phosphorylation. SiRNA mediated MET-knockdown reduced cell migration but not cell growth. Crizotinib treatment led to a decrease in cell growth and migration. At 25 nmol/L of crizotinib, only the migration of G-protein mutant cells lines and not G-protein wild type cell lines was decreased. Crizotinib did not lead to a reduction in tumor volume of two cell lines in vivo but reduced the formation of macrometastases (luciferase activity, p=0.03)."
1587,"Among 46 AML patients treated with decitabine, the response rate was 75% (6/8) among DNMT3A mutated and 34% (13/38) among DNMT3A wild-type patients (P=.008)"
1588,"Case report of a patient with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues. Overexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro. The patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity."
1589,Case report of a patient with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months with subsequent disease progression.
1591,"Open-label non-randomised phase 2 trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic BRAF V600E mutant papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine. Patients had (cohort 2) or had not (cohort 1) previously been treated with VEGFR inhibitors. 51 patients were enrolled (26 cohort 1, 25 cohort 2). In cohort 1, partial response was achieved in ten (38.5%) patients. Nine patients achieved stable disease for at least 6 months (35%). Median PFS was 18.2 months and median OS not reached after a median follow-up pf 18.8 months. In cohort 2, six patients (27.3%) achieved a partial response and another six patients achieved stable disease for at least six months. Median PFS was 8.9 months and median OS was 14.4. months."
1592,Osimertinib has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.
1597,"Western blot analyses were performed for HR23b (RAD23B) expression sarcoma cell lines after treatment with vorinostat, belinostat, mocetinostat and entinostat. All HDACi were able to regulate proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. Sensitivity to vorinostat correlated significantly with HR23b protein expression. IHC in 523 patient samples revealed high HR23b expression in 12.5% of sarcomas (among them malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, pleomorphic liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, dedifferentiated liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas and angiosarcomas) and 23.2% of GIST."
1600,"Three PI3K mutant breast cancer cell lines were rendered resistant to PI3K inhibitors (BYL719 or GDC-0941), and a panel of 42 inhibitor compounds was tested on the cells for ability to resensitize the cells to PI3K inhibition. The CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib (LEE011) acted synergistically with PI3K inhibitor to reduce viability in all three resistant cell lines. In a panel of 12 PIK3CA mutant and 10 wild type cell lines, synergistic effects between P110alpha inhibitor BYL719 and ribociclib were significantly stronger (weighted synergy score calculation, ANOVA, p=0.012) in PIK3CA mutant cells, indicating variant specific sensitization. Mouse xenografts of 4 different PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells resistant to PI3K inhibitor showed stronger regression under dual PI3K inhibitor and ribociclib treatment than with either treatment alone."
1601,Case report of a 60-year old woman with lung adenocarcinoma. After negative testing for EGFR mutations and ALK translocations and failure of platinum-based chemotherapy she was enrolled on a nintedanib-docetaxel trial. Docetaxel was discontinued after 22 cycles because of edema and fatigue. A total of 48 treatment cycles (26 cycles of nintedanib alone) was administered over 33 months before documentation of disease progression in March 2013. Genomic testing revealed a CCDC6-RET fusion but no other actionable mutations (confirmed by FISH).
1603,"Case report of a 67 year old woman with high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy and palliative cystectomy followed by tumor progression and pulmonary lesion enlargement. Genomic profiling of the cystectomy specimen identified FGFR3, CCND1 and FGF19 amplification as well as an FGFR3 S249C mutation (allele frequency 58%). Pazopanib was initiated on the basis of these findings and a partial response was achieved for >6 months."
1604,"Dovitinib was evaluated in-vitro, in xenograft and in a phase 2 study. Dovitinib inhibited proliferation in one FGFR1- and one FGFR2-amplified breast cancer cell lines at higher IC50 values than in 11 nonamplified cell lines. Dovitinib inhibited tumor growth and caused regression in both a FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified xenograft model. 81 patients were enrolled in the trial and treated with dovitinib. Unconfirmed response or stable disease >6 months was observed in 25% of FGFR1-amplified/HR-positive vs. 3% FGFR1-nonamplified/HR-positive breast cancer patientes. When FGF3 and FGFR2 amplifications were also assessed, a combined FGF-pathway amplified patient group had a higher mean reduction in target lesion size than patients with FGF-non-amplified tumors."
1605,"Dovitinib was evaluated in-vitro, in xenograft and in a phase 2 study. Dovitinib inhibited proliferation in one FGFR1- and one FGFR2-amplified breast cancer cell lines at higher IC50 values than in 11 nonamplified cell lines. Dovitinib inhibited tumor growth and caused regression in both a FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified xenograft model. 81 patients were enrolled in the trial and treated with dovitinib. 2 patients were reported to harbor FGFR2 amplifications and both had a reduction in tumor size of 18.5 and 28.2%, respectively. When FGFR1, FGF3 and FGFR2 amplifications were combined, a combined FGF-pathway amplified patient group had a higher mean reduction in target lesion size than patients with FGF-non-amplified tumors."
1606,"81 patients were enrolled in a clinical trial with the FGFR inhibitor dovitinib. Four of these patients had FGF3 amplifications (qPCR) and showed tumor reductions of 100%, 30.8%, 23.0%, and 7.5%, respectively. 3 of these 4 patients also had FGFR1 amplifications (≥6 copies by qPCR) and the fourth presented with FGFR1-gene gain (3.4 copies of FGFR1 by qPCR and SISH negative)."
1607,"Three PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines were rendered resistant to PI3K inhibitors (BYL719 or GDC-0941) by chronic exposure. Co-treatment of all three cell lines with PI3K inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib resulted in synergistic reductions in cell viability which were not seen with treatment of either compound alone, and resulted in similar suppression to viability as seen in the respective PI3K inhibitor sensitive parental cell lines."
1608,Homozygous VHL R200W mutations result in a rare congenital polycythemia known as Chuvash polycythemia. Treatment of 3 patients with this disease with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib led to symptomatic and hematologic improvements in all patients through 21-78 weeks of treatment.
1610,A panel of 31 breast cancer cell lines was tested for sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor PP242. Inhibitor concentrations for 50% survival fraction (SF50) were measured and SF50 less than one micro molar was considered sensitive. PIK3CA mutant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to both everolimus and PP242 than PIK3CA wild type cell lines. Apoptotic indicators and cell cycle analysis indicated that the mTOR inhibitors induced G1 arrest instead of apoptosis in the cell lines.
1612,"Sensitivity to mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242 was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with various mutation backgrounds. PTEN and PIK3CA mutations were heavily represented in the panel. However, a PTEN and PIK3CA wild type cell line 'HS578T' was found to harbor a mutation in the PI3K regulatory protein PIK3R1. Like PIK3CA mutant cell lines, the PIK3R1 mutant HS578T line was also determined to be sensitive to PP242. Approximately 70% of PIK3CA wild type lines were not sensitive to PP242. This suggests that mutations in the PI3K holoenzyme may be targetable by mTORC1/2 inhibition."
1613,"In a panel of 31 breast cancer cell lines with varied mutation backgrounds, 10 cell lines harbored HER2 (ERBB2) amplification. Sensitivity to the mTORC1/2 inhibitor PP242 was assessed, and 8/10 HER2 positive cell lines were reported to be sensitive (IC50 < 1 micro molar PP242). 8/21 without HER2 amplification were reported as resistant (IC50 > 1 micro molar PP242). This pattern of HER2 positive cell sensitivity was not reported with the rapamycin analog mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus."
1614,"A panel of 24 endometroid endometrial cancer (EEC) cell lines was characterized for mutations and 18 cell lines were found to have mutations in PTEN or absence of expression. Cell lines were assessed for sensitivity to mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor temsirolimus, and it was reported that PTEN loss had significant association with temsirolimus sensitivity. ."
1616,"A panel of 24 endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) cell lines was characterized for a set of mutations and sensitivity to pan PI3K class I inhibitor GDC-0941 (pictilisib) was assessed. EEC cell lines with PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to GDC-0941 (Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed, P=0.038). Some of the PIK3CA mutant cells contained PTEN and KRAS mutations, but in these cells, these mutations did not effect sensitivity."
1617,Case study of a 46-year old male patient with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome and pancreatic cancer. A germline STK11 D194E mutation was identified with LOH in the tumor sample. phospho-S6 ribosomal protein staining was observed in the tumor indicating mTOR pathway activation. Everolimus treatement led to partial response (but no change in phospho-S6 ribosomal protein staining) for 9 months.
1618,"Preclinical study in a mouse model of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Heterozygous Lkb1 (STK11) knockout mice were generated and treated with rapamycin after the onset of polyposis at 9 months of age. Rapamycin treatment significantly suppressed polyposis (p=0.017) and pS6 staining (IHC, p=0.011)."
1619,Treatment of mice with a heterozygous loss of Lkb1 (STK11) with rapamycin led to reduction in polyp size (p < 0.0001) and number of polyps (p=0.00022). pS6 staining was also reduced after rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin treatment abolished FDG-PET signal on imaging.
1621,"Case report of a 74-year old woman with EGFR- and ALK-negative lung adenocarcinoma. FISH identified a deletion of 5'RET (FISH, indicating RET-gene rearrangement) and genomic testing confirmed a fusion of KIF5B and RET, as well as an AKT2 gene amplification. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial with vandetanib and everolimus (NCT01582191) with everolimus used to enhance brain accumulation of vandetanib. After two cycles of therapy a repeat MRI brain showed a decrease in the intracranial disease burden and PET/CT showed systemic response as well."

1623,"Case report of a 44-year-old patient with recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary tumor was HR positive; however, the metastatic tumor was HR negative. The patient was resistant to classical chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 treatment. Thus, the combination of everolimus and fulvestrant was administered. The patient experienced stable disease and PFS of 10 months. Genetic testing of pleural effusion after disease progression revealed a PIK3CA H1047R gene mutation but was positive for PTEN expression (IHC)."
1625,"Preclinical study in thyroid cancer cell lines. 6 cell lines with alterations of the PI3K/Akt pathway were more sensitive to Akt inhibitor perifosine or MTOR inhibitor temsirolimus than 5 cell lines without genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. Among the alterations, One cell line harbored a PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Transfection of another cell line with this mutation led to lower IC50 values to perifosine and temsirolimus than in a cell line transfected with a control vector. Perifosine treatment also increased apoptosis of a thyroid tumor xenograft with PIK3CA H1047R mutation."

This cell line harbored the lowest IC50 values to both perifosine and temsirolimus and also showed increased apoptosis with perifosine in a xenograft model."
1628,mTOR protein levels were found to underly a circadian 24-hour rhythm regulated by time-dependent Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination. Survival rates of tumor-bearing mice with everolimus showed time-dependency consistent with mTOR protein levels. It could be hypothesized that FBXW7 loss leads to an increase in mTOR protein levels independent of circadian regulation and higher sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
1631,"418 patients with advanced cancer were screened for FBXW7 mutations using a multiplex gene panel. 17 FBXW7 mutations were detected (isolated mutation in 2 patients). Ten patients were treated with an mTOR inhibitor with 7 patients having stable disease as best responses and a median time to treatment failure of 2.8 months, two patients had prolonged stable disease of >16 weeks."
1632,"FBXW7 was shown to target mTOR for ubiquitination and degradation. A reciprocal relationship between FBXW7 or PTEN loss was identified in breast cancer tumors and cell lines (mutual exclusivity of these two events). In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway."
1633,"A 67-year-old female presents with recurrent metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical and genetic workup showed overexpression of c-JUN and FOS, which presumably signals through the RAAS pathway. The patient was treated with irbesartan and after 5 weeks of therapy, the CEA value decreased from 18 to 3.1 and there was radiological resolution of the disease. Her 10 month CEA was 1.4."

1641,"In a study of 30 patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, 87% had MYD88(L265P) mutations. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88(L265P) were treated with an MYD88 homodimerization inhibitor or an IRAK 1/4 kinase inhibitor. The cells showed a decrease in staining of NF-kappa-B p65 phosphorylation."
1642,"Phase 2 study in Asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 70 patients received refametinib (BAY 86-9766) plus sorafenib as study treatment. A retrospective biomarker analysis was performed in 69 patients for KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations (BEAM technology). 4 patients were identified to harbor RAS mutations. 3 of whom still received study treatment at the cutoff date used for the final data analysis. These 3 patients had achieved confirmed PR, with duration responses ranging from 128 to 382 days. The fourth patient with a RAS mutation discontinued study treatment after 41 days on therapy due to PD. An overall of 4 (6 by modified RECIST) patients achieved PR."
1647,"A retrospective tumor sample study found that the loss of ATRX expression (less than 10% of nuclei) in IDH-mutant astrocytomas treated with temozolomide or a combination of procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) was associated with better outcomes. Patients with IDH-mutant tumors and ATRX expression loss (n=40) experienced greater time to treatment failure (55.6 months vs. 31.8 months; P = 0.0168) and a greater progression-free survival (37.1 months vs. 18.1 months; P = 0.038) compared to patients with IDH-mutant tumors with ATRX expression (n=9)."

1653,"A retrospective study examining the expression of AURKA in tumor samples of 78 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients found that positive expression of AURKA (>10% of cells by IHC) was correlated with increased clinical response to chemoradiation therapy consisting of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 40 gy radiation (P = 0.0003)."
1661,Case report of a 51-year old patient with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Selumetinib treatment in a phase-II trial led to a complete and durable response > 5 years. Sequencing (MSK-IMPACT Panel) was performed on the patients tumor and germline and identified a 15-bp in-frame deletion of MAP2K1 (8.3% of tumor reads but 0% in germline). In-silico modelling suggested loss of negative feedback on kinase activity from this deletion.In-vitro expression of the MEK1 Q56_V60 deletion as well as the previously characterized MEK1 F53L mutation in 293H cells resulted in elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase as compared with wild-type MEK1 as well as increased colony formation and tumor growth in-vivo. Selumetinib treatment of MEK1-transfected cells confirmed retained sensitivity to MEK inhibition and inhibition of colony formation.
1662,"One patient with low-grade serous ovarian cancer had an in-frame fusion between the BRAF kinase domain and CUL1 identified by panel sequencing (MSK-IMPACT), with expression confirmed by whole-transcriptome sequencing. This patient with metastatic disease after treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, was enrolled onto a study of paclitaxel in combination with an oral MEK inhibitor and achieved a CR. She continued to receive therapy for 7 months, until discontinuation because of the development of pneumonitis. At publication, sustained CR had lasted > 18 months."
1663,"Analysis of BRAF fusions in 20,573 tumors, across 12 distinct tumor types. BRAF fusions were identified in 55 (0.3%) patients and enriched in spitzoid melanoma, pilocytic astrocytomas, pancreatic acinar and papillary thyroid cancers. Clinical data were available for two patients. Among them one 46-year old woman with spitzoid melanoma that harbored a ZKSCAN1-BRAF fusion responded to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Subcutaneous tumor nodules exhibited clinical responses within 14 days of therapy, and her dominant bulky right lung metastases showed significant response by Day 45. Subsequent robotic-assisted lobectomy was able to remove the previously unresectable tumor with clean surgical margins."
1664,"A patient with a malignant spindle cell tumor of the chest wall treated as a soft tissue sarcoma was identified to harbor a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. This patient responded to treatment with the pan-kinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with bevacizumab and temsirolimus, achieving stable disease after 2 cycles extending into 11 cycles at which time she expired due to co-morbidities (acute myocardial infarction, hypotension). Of note, sequencing of 236 cancer-related genes identified CDKN2A A68fs*51, SUFU E283fs*3, MAP3K1 N325fs*3 and homozygous deletion of PTEN as well."
1665,"90 NSCLC patients with stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-resistant tumors were treated with gefitinib, and the L858R EGFR mutation was associated with longer time to treatment failure than those with wild-type EGFR (median 9.1 versus 2.1).

1698,"A 65-year-old man presented with stage II myeloma. He was initially treated with chemotherapy and he received an autologous stem cell transplant. Sequencing of the recurrent tumor harbored BRAF V600E mutation and he was treated with vemurafenib. After 7 weeks of treatment, the patient relapsed and died."
1699,A 54-year-old man presented with stage II myeloma. He was initially treated with chemotherapy and received an autologous stem cell transplant. Genomic profiling of the bone biopsy revealed BRAF V600E activating mutation and the patient was treated with vemurafenib. At 4-months post treatment (time of case study report) the patient maintains near-resolution of hypermetabolic lesions.
1706,"Four myeloma cell lines were treated with two different BET inhibitors (I-BET151 or JQ1). Proliferation of three cell lines (KMS11, RPMI8226 and MM1S) but not U266 (only partial inhibition) was strongly inhibited by the BET inhibitors. Microarray analysis showed a downregulation of MYC-dependent genes after treatment. qRT-PCR showed that MYCL1 but not c-MYC and MYCN was expressed in U266 cells and I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1. In contrast, c-MYC but not MYCL was expressed in the other cell lines and I-BET151 induced downregulation of c-MYC."
1707,Three metastatic glioblastoma cell lines were compared with their parental cell lines with regard to differential gene expression. HGF signalling was among the top pathways identified. Exogenous HFG led to an increase in MET activity (except in one cell line with high endogenous HGF levels) which was abrogated by MET inhibitor SGX523. Three HGF autocrine cell lines were grown in mice and showed significantly increased sensitivity to SGX523 than three non-HGF autocrine cell lines (P<0.05).
1708,"463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, with metastatic CRC progressive after standard chemotherapy were randomized to panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC, n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Objective response rates favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), but 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study."

Significant difference was seen in objective response with 70% of cases with afatinib vs. 56% of cases with gefitinib. Median progression free survival was 11.0 months (10.6-12.9) with afatinib and 10.9 months (9.1-11.5) with gefitinib, HR 0.73 [0.57-0.95] p=0.017."
1731,"The alpelisib (PI3Kalpha inhibitor) resistant breast cancer cell line HCC1954 was treated with alpelsisb alone or in combination with the SGK1 kinase inhibitor SGK1-Inh. Addition of SGK1 reduced viability over alpelisib alone, and phospho-S6K as well as phospho-4EBP1 levels decreased with combination treatment. HCC1954 xenografts showed increased tumor volume with treatment of alpelisib or SGK1-Inh alone, but only combination treatment resulted in lack of volume increase and decreased phospho-S6K levels in tumors by IHC."
1733,"This open-label, randomized, phase-3 clinical trial compared pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in treating NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of EGFR or translocation of ALK.

1736,"This small clinical (n=56) study suggests that patients with minor mutations of EGFR, like G719S, are likely to have a moderate response to Tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Gefitinib and Erlotinib. In this study 44 of 56 patients were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. 35 patients had a G719 mutation but the majority of these were G719S (20 with G719S, 9 with G719A, 3 with G719C)."
1738,"Non-V600 BRAF mutations occur in about half of BRAF-mutated lung cancers, and their sensitivity to Dabrafenib and Trametinib is not well documented. In a cohort of 229 NSCLC patients that underwent molecular testing, one was found to have a BRAF G596C mutation. This mutation had low kinase activity and reduced MEK/ERK activation compared to wtBRAF in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Elevated MEK/ERK activation was seen when BRAF G596C was expressed in the presence of CRAF, and this activity was inhibited by both Dabrafenib and Trametinib. A lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) expressing BRAF G596C showed reduced ERK activation when treated with combination Dabrafenib and Trametinib. These results support the use of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in MAPK pathway inhibition in the context of kinase-impaired BRAF mutants such as G596C."

This study compared in vitro EPZ-6438 treatment of four SMARCB1-deleted MRT cell lines to three control (wild-type) cell lines. These data demonstrate the dependency of SMARCB1 mutant MRTs on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggest treatment of these genetically defined cancers with EZH2 inhibitors.
1742,"NF2 loss promotes oncogenic RAS-signaling via YAP-dependent transactivation of RAS and sensitizes to MEK inhibition. The authors demonstrate this in (A) isogenic lines derived from C643 cells (HRASG13R, NF2-WT) modified to stably express shNF2, (B) in set of 7 RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines that differ in their NF2 expression levels, and (C) in a Hras-G12V/Nf2-null mouse model."

1781,Treatment of the patient-derived 797 NMC cell line for 48 hours with JQ1 (500 nM) provoked terminal differentiation which was accompanied by growth arrest and sustained inhibition of proliferation. Non-BRD4-dependent cell lines including a squamous carcinoma cell line (TE10) failed to exhibit differentiation effects when treated with JQ1.
1786,"In a meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of erlotinib, one patient was described with the exon 19 mutation K757R from the MERIT study.

A high neoantigen load was identified.
1862,Case report of a patient with endometrial cancer and exceptional response to pembrolizumab (maintained at 14 months). POLE mutations V411L (exonuclease domain) and R114* were identified in the primary tumor as well as a resected lymph node metastasis. The tumor harbored a high mutational load as assessed by panel sequencing. Analysis of TCGA RNA-seq data revealed an association between POLE mutations and high immune marker expression.
1864,"Case report of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring both a mutation in EGFR and an amplification of MET. After progression on erlotinib the patient was treated with combined type I MET (savolitinib) and EGFR (osimertinib) inhibition and responded. When resistance developed, a new MET kinase domain mutation, D1228V, was detected. Drug binding predictions and in vitro studies demonstrated that the D1228V mutation induces resistance to type I but not type II MET TKIs. The patient was treated with erlotinib (EGFR TKI) combined with cabozantinib, a type II MET inhibitor, and had a response which continued at the time of report (5 months)."
1866,"Study evaluated a total of 50 small cell lung cancer patients with extensive stage disease. Multivariate analysis identified RB1 as a factor in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy (odds ratio 5.58 compared to WT, p=.038).

1867,"Randomized, international, open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT02151981) in 419 patients with T790M-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. Patients were randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to oral osimertinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, maintenance pemetrexed was allowed). Primary end point was PFS, which was significantly longer with osimertinib than with chemotherapy (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; HR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). Objective response rate was significantly better with osimertinib (71%; 95% CI, 65 to 76) than with chemotherapy (31%; 95% CI, 24 to 40) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95% CI, 3.47 to 8.48; P<0.001)."
1868,"In 1378 cases of NSCLC screened for NTRK1 rearrangements, 2 were identified (frequency 0.1%). One patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1 was treated with entrectinib in a phase 1 study.

1879,"A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a patient with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) loss and FUS-ERG fusion positive Ewing's sarcoma was created. The PDX was treated in four cohorts (each N=6) with control, doxorubicin, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib or IGF-1R inhibitor linsitinib. Both linsitinib and palbociclib cohorts were significantly more effective than control and doxorubicin.

1881,"An imatinib-resistant cell line, DFSP105, was established from a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans which had progressed to a high-grade fibrosarcomatous DFSP. The disease-associated COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was consistent with the most common form, a supernumerary ring chromosome. Genetic characterization of the cell line with a SNP array identified a homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion. Treatment of this cell line with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib led to growth inhibition and reduced RB1 phosphorylation in vitro and in-vivo."
1888,"A Phase II study for use of Afatinib in non- or light smokers with lung adenocarcinoma. Three patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified (Y772_A775dup, G776L, and G778_P780dup). Objective response was observed in all three of these patients.

Three patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified (Y772_A775dup, G776L, and G778_P780dup). Objective response was observed in all three of these patients. The patient with G778_P780dup (Case 3 in the paper), had a rapid clinical and symptomatic response to Afatinib and stable disease which lasted for 3 months. Progressive disease at 4 months led to the addition of paclitaxel, resulting in partial response. Total Afatinib treatment was 15 months (11 in combination) at which time the patient developed a brain metastasis but no other progressive disease."
1892,"Phase 2 trial of ERBB-inhibitor dacomitinib in stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. Two patients were identified with identical HER2 p.G778_P780dup mutations (p. P780_Y781insGSP, c. 2339_2340ins GGCTCCCCA) and no amplification. Both had a confirmed partial response lasting 11 and 14 months.

Out of 40 BRCA mutant (BRCA1 or BRCA2) patients, 14 had homozygous somatic BRCA1 mutation or deletion. Confirmed objective response was seen in 71% (10/14) of the somatic BRCA1 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001)."
1898,"A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer was enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01174121). 24 cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were expanded from 3 lung metastasis resections. After cultures were tested for reactivity, the patient was infused with 1.48 x 10^11 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (75% CD8+ T cells) that were specifically reactive to KRAS G12D. All 7 metastatic lung lesions regressed 40 days after therapy, and the patient had a 9-month partial response."
1900,A JAK1 S703I mutation was found to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo in hepatocellular carcinoma. Ruxolitinib causes the suppression of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in PDX models bearing JAK1 S703I mutation and delays tumor progression.
1902,"Phase 1b study of vemurafenib, cetuximab and irinotecan in 19 patients with colorectal cancer (1 with appendiceal cancer). Six of 17 evaluable patients achieved an objective response, 15 patients total had either stable disease or radiographic response (the patient with appendiceal cancer had disease progression). Estimated median PFS was 7.7 months. Effect of the combined treatment was also observed in xenograft and cell line studies."
1907,Two ATM deficient mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines were more sensitive to PARP-1 inhibition with olaparib or PJ-34 than 4 other MCL cell lines. shRNA mediated ATM knockdown in a cell line increased sensitivity to olaparib. These results were confirmed in a xenograft model.

1923,"AKT3 was found to be preferentially required for the proliferation and tumor growth of TNBC. It was found to be upregulated in a set of TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer types. Depletion of AKT3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. It was found that depletion of Akt3 potentially inhibits the growth of TNBC cell lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, which imply that therapeutic targeting of AKT3 may provide a new treatment option for TNBCs."
1924,"The authors show that in the CX-5461 and CX-3543, G-quadruplex stabilizing agents, demonstrate specific toxicity against BRCA deficient breast cancer derived cells and polyclonal patient-derived xenograft models. Xenografts harbored both a germline BRCA and a somatic BRCA mutation leading to disruption of both. The BRCA and NHEJ pathways are required for the repair of CX-5461 and CX-3543-induced DNA damage and failure to do so leads to lethality."

1936,"Expression of an alternative ALK transcript (ATI), encompassing exons 20–29 preceded by ~400 base pairs (bp) of intron 19, but not exons 1–19 was identified in three samples of thyroid cancer and melanoma. In TCGA samples, ALK ATI was expressed in approx. 11% of melanoma samples. Functional activity of ALK ATI was shown in-vitro. In vivo studies confirmed oncogenic activity of ALK ATI similar to other ALK mutations or fusions and sensitivity to crizotinib.

1937,"This open label Phase 3 Trial performed across 36 centers in Japan (WJTOG3405) assessed patients with postoperative recurrent or stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations (Exon 19 deletion and L858R). 88 patients were treated with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, while 89 were treated with cisplatin/docetaxel. Progression free survival was significantly longer with gefitinib treatment with a median of 9.2 months vs. 6.3 with cisplatin/docetaxel (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.336-0.710; p<0.0001). Difference in response to gefitinib between the two EGFR mutation types was not observed."
1952,Preclinical study in uveal melanoma. Increased PKC activity was found in uveal melanoma cell lines with GNA11 or GNAQ mutations (n=6) compared to GNA wt cell lines (n=4) and could be induced by introducing these mutations into wt cell lines. Cell lines carrying GNA mutations were more sensitive to PKC inhibition with AEB071 and AHT956 in vitro and in vivo. Combined inhibition of MEK and PKC with AEB071 and PD0325901led to sustained MAPK-signalling blockade and induced apoptosis.

PDGFRA R841K was detected in one sample of mucosal melanoma. In vitro, PDGFRA R841K expressed in IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 cells resulted in strong auto-phosphorylation and cell growth of PDGFRA independent of the presence of IL-3, suggesting oncogenicity. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA and cell proliferation. The authors concluded that PDGFRA R841K is sensitive to imatinib and crenolanib."

1979,"Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors."
1980,"MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression as well as promoter methylation status were analyzed in breast cancer patients and seven breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of MTAP in one cell line with strong endogenous MTAP expression (MDA-MB-435) increased sensitivity to inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX), mainly 5-FU."
1984,"18 advanced progressing chordoma patients that were positive for EGFR by at least one technique (immunohistochemistry and/or phospho-arrays, real-time polymerase chain reaction for EGFR ligands, FISH) entered this phase 2 study investigating the efficacy of lapatinib (median age: 61 years; disease extent: metastatic 72% and locally advanced 28%). Of the 25 patients screened, three tested negative for EGFR. Six (33.3%) patients had PR and 7 (38.9%) SD, as their best Choi responses, corresponding to RECIST SD in all cases. Median PFS by Choi was 6 [interquartile (IQ) range 3-8] months. Median PFS by RECIST was 8 (IQ range 4-12) months, with a 22% CBR. This phase II study showed a modest antitumor activity of lapatinib in chordoma"
1986,"Cell proliferation analysis of Ba/F3 cells expressing ERBB2-T862A showed IC50 value of 125nM and IC90 of approximately 0.5 µM, and was considered as lapatinib-sensitive. Since levels of up to 1 µM of lapatinib may be achieved in patients, ERBB2-T862A might respond to higher doses of lapatinib. However, results of a drug resistance screen for lapatinib describe T862A as a potential secondary resistance mutation which would seem to contradict the sensitivity conclusion."
1987,"Cell proliferation analysis of Ba/F3 cells expressing ERBB2-V773A showed IC50 value of 146nM and IC90 of approximately 0.5 µM, and was considered as lapatinib-sensitive. Since levels of up to 1 µM of lapatinib may be achieved in patients, ERBB2-V773A might respond to higher doses of lapatinib."
1988,"Cell proliferation analysis of Ba/F3 cells expressing ERBB2-N857S showed IC50 value of 75nM and IC90 of approximately 0.5 µM, and was considered as lapatinib-sensitive. Since levels of up to 1 µM of lapatinib may be achieved in patients, ERBB2-N857S might respond to higher doses of lapatinib."
1989,"Cell proliferation analysis of ERBB2 mutant expressing cell lines showed that the ERBB2-H878Y mutant, which is observed in 11% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, had the highest sensitivity against lapatinib.

1990,"Nine patients with FGFR2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer were treated with AZD4547. Of these 9 patients, 3 showed confirmed responses to AZD4547. Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range=6.2-10.5). Two additional patients had a response in day 15 using FDG-PET but were not considered complete responders by RECIST criteria. High-level FGFR2-amplified (arbitrarily defined as FISH-ratio > 5) cancers had a higher likelihood of response and were associated with a substantially higher expression of both FGFR2 mRNA and FGFR2 protein (IHC). In vitro and in PDX models, FGFR2-amplified cell lines were sensitive to FGFR inhibition. Further preclinical analyses suggested, that FGFR2 amplification mainly signals via the PI3K pathway."
1991,"Activity of the FGFR-selective inhibitor AZD4547 in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer and FGFR2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer was analyzed in this study. 341 patients with advanced cancer were screened by FISH, identifying FGFR1 amplification in 18% of advanced HER2-negative breast cancers and FGFR2 amplification in 9% of advanced gastroesophageal cancer. 1 patient had a confirmed response among 8 patients treated with FGFR1-amplified breast cancer. In a preclinical model, FGFR1 amplification in breast cancer cell lines was less pronounced than FGFR2-amplifications in gastroesophageal cancers, which also had a higher response rate in the trial, indicating that high level amplification is associated with response and less common in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer."
1992,"Case report of a 60-year old patient with p16 positive tumor of the tonsil with lung metastases after primary radiochemotherapy. The metastases were analyzed using a commercial molecular analysis and overexpression of HER2 was identified (IHC, 95% of cells, with high intensity 3+ staining) which was confirmed on RNA-level. The patient was treated with single-agent lapatinib. A locally recurrent tumor was excised (and found HER2-negative) and the patient continued on lapatinib (for 2 years) as well as 5 cycles 5-FU and irinotecan.

The study found that patients whose tumors harbored mutations in KIT exon 11 had signficantly superior responses to imatinib, regardless of dose, than those whose tumors harbored wildtype KIT or KIT exon 9 mutations. This is evidenced by the findings that imatinib-treated patients whose tumors contained KIT exon 11 mutations had longer overall survival compared to those with exon 9 mutations (60.0mo vs.38.4mo, P=0.011) or wildtype KIT (60mo vs. 49.0mo, P=0.049). Patients with exon 11 mutations had improved progression-free survival in comparison to those with exon 9 mutations (24.7mo vs. 16.7mo, P=0.0013) or wildtype KIT (24.7mo vs. 12.8mo, P=0.005)."

Two patients' GISTs harbored KIT exon 13 mutations, and both experienced partial responses to imatinib. The authors conclude that this uncommon variant is sensitive to imatinib."
2480,"In a prospective phase III study (SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105) of 407 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 397 patients were observed to be CD117-positive (i.e. KIT-positive) and 10 patients were CD117-negative. Patients were treated with either 400mg or 800mg of imatinib per day. When compared to CD117-positive, GISTs, CD117-negative GISTs did not show significant difference in median time to progression (18.3 months vs. 20.5 months; P = 0.46), however, CD-117-negative GISTs showed reduced overall survival relative to CD-117-positive GISTs (25.8 months vs. 57.1 months; P= 0.01)."
2487,"This prospective study of 127 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs."
2505,"Patients were treated with a specific RAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), which improved overall survival of patients with BRAF mutations (P<0.003), compared to non-treated patients with BRAF mutations. Patients having BRAF mutations were associated with reduced overall survival (11.1 mo vs. 46.1 mo for wild-type, P=0.006).

Two of 19 melanomas examined harbored KIT mutations, with one subject harboring a D820Y mutation. Western blotting showed KIT phosphorylation (Y219) in this case and the SM3 cell line harboring the D820Y mutation. The SM3 cell line showed significant growth inhibition with sunitinib exposures of 1uM and 10uM while imatinib showed no activity. The authors comment that this indicates a potential role for sunitinib in growth inhibition of acral melanomas."
2889,"A 69 y.o. woman presented with metastatic mucosal melanoma of the anus. KIT was amplified in the tumor and harbored the K642E mutation. Post surgery with extensive margins, she was given a dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and adjuvant radiation therapy for 2.5 weeks. Two weeks post radiation she developed nodules in the same region and testing indicated they were malignant melanoma with high KIT expression. She enrolled in a clinical trial with a dose of 400mg imatinib per day (Nov 2006). Less than 4 weeks later, all nodules had disappeared. Upon a lowered dosage to 200mg of imatinib, the nodules returned and subsequently the dosage was increased to 600mg/day. The patient remained melanoma-free on 600mg imatinib until a follow up in Jan 2008. The authors do not provide further details on patient outcome."
2899,"In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy."
2901,"This study showed that low MGMT mRNA expression was strongly predictive for prolonged time to progression, treatment response, and length of survival in univariate and multivariate models (p<0.0001). The degree of MGMT mRNA expression was highly correlated with the MGMT promoter methylation status (p<0.0001); however, discordant findings were seen in 12 glioblastoma patients. Patients with methylated tumors with high MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did significantly worse than those with low transcriptional activity (p<0.01). Conversely, unmethylated tumors with low MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did better than their counterparts."
2902,"In this study, loss of chromosome 1p and low MGMT protein expression were associated with objective response (P < .003 and P < .04, respectively). However, only 54% of the study group had evaluation of 1p/19q status, and MGMT protein expression was studied in only 33%. Therefore, the association between 1p deletion and low MGMT protein expression was statistically significant when evaluated further and verified in the extended group of 31 patients with low-grade oligodendrogliomas."

One Q61K line was not sensitive to these inhibitors."
2915,"Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway."

The authors discovered that 2HG overproduction impairs homologous recombination used in DNA repair and sensitizes cancer cells to treatment with PARP inhibitors, another class of cancer drugs that are already in clinical use."
2936,"Mutational profiling of 207 lung adenocarcinomas identified in 2 of with activating mutation in exon 2 of MEK1 (K57N) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase. Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the EGFR signaling pathway (i.e., EGFR, HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF). Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, MEK1 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/F3 cells. A selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, inhibits mutant-induced ERK activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/F3 cells."
2937,"NEMO is an ongoing, randomised, open-label phase 3 study of patients with advanced, unresectable, AJCC IIIC/IV NRAS-mutant melanoma. 402 patients that were previously untreated or progressed on or after previous immunotherapy were randomised to receive either binimetinib (269) or dacarbazine (133). The study's primary endpoint was progression free survival. Median follow-up was 1.7 months (IQR 1.4-4.1). Median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.8-3.6) in the binimetinib group and 1.5 months (1.5-1.7) in the dacarbazine group, demonstrating improved progression-free survival of binimetinib compared with dacarbazine."

2953,"Results from a phase I study show that the TRK inhibitor LOXO-101 is well tolerated and effective, with patients whose tumors bear NTRK fusions responding well and durably to this targeted therapy. This publication reported results from an AACR meeting for an ongoing study that had enrolled six patients with NTRK fusions, three of whom could be evaluated at the time. Each had a different, heavily pretreated advanced disease: soft-tissue sarcoma; gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); and MASC. All three patients experienced partial responses by 3-4 months with resolution of key tumour-related symptoms within two weeks. One of three patients experienced near-complete response by 8 months."
2955,"LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers."

2965,"Phase I Trial of RG7112 in 116 heavily pretreated patients with AML, ALL, CML, CLL, sCLL demonstrated sustained clinical improvement and induction of TP53 target genes in subset of patients with wild type TP53. 96 patients were tested for TP53 mutation and 19 cases of mutation were detected. No sustained clinical improvement or induction of TP53 target genes was observed in patients with mutant TP53."
2982,"High-throughput drug screens in OCCC tumor cell model identified synthetic lethal (SL) interaction between the kinase inhibitor dasatinib and ARID1A mutation. Imposing ARID1A deficiency upon a variety of human or mouse cells induced dasatinib sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo."
2983,"A screen was performed to identify small molecule inhibitors that inhibit growth of ARID1A inactivated cells using shRNA knockdown in ARID1A wild-type ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cell line RMG1. The EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 was the drug with the highest selectivity against ARID1A knockdown cells as measured by decrease in acini size in 3D culture. GSK126 also decreased growth of ARID1A mutant ovarian cancer cell lines (TOV21G, OVISE, OVTOKO and SKOV3) but not wild-type cell lines. OVISE cells were injected into immunocompromised mice to to test GSK126 in vivo and treatment caused significant decreases in orthotopic tumour sizes relative to controls. It was also noted that GSK126 caused reduced OCCC dissemination as measured by the number of tumour nodules following intraperitoneal injection of OVISE cells in immunocompromised mice."
2984,"CaSki cells that are heterozygous for the PIK3CA-E545K mutation are more resistant to cisplatin or cisplatin plus radiation than either HeLa or SiHa cells that express only wild-type PIK3CA. Similarly, HeLa cells engineered to stably express PIK3CA-E545K were more resistant to cisplatin or cisplatin plus radiation than cells expressing only wild-type PIK3CA or with PIK3CA depleted. Cells expressing the PIK3CA-E545K mutation also had constitutive PI3K pathway activation and increased cellular migration and each of these phenotypes was reversed by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941/Pictilisib. In addition, GDC-0941 restored sensitivity of E545K mutant cell lines to cisplatin as combination treatment had a larger impact on cell survival than either drug alone."
2987,"Clinical trial of entrectinib in patients with ALK/ROS/TRK altered tumors. One patient with an ALK F1245V-mutant neuroblastoma achieved a durable, confirmed partial response (PR) lasting 8.3 months. The patient remained on study treatment for more than 3.5 years because of clinical benefit."
2991,"Highest MERTK expression was observed in metastatic melanomas, followed by primary melanomas, and lowest in benign nevi. Over half of melanoma cell lines overexpressed MERTK compared with normal human melanocytes; however, overexpression did not correlate with mutations in BRAF or RAS. MERTK inhibition via shRNA reduced MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, reduced colony formation by up to 59%, and diminished tumor volume by 60% in a human melanoma murine xenograft model. Treatment of melanoma cells with UNC1062, a novel MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced activation of MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, induced apoptosis in culture, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells."

In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA."

6183,"In a Japanese Phase III clinical trial, noninferiority of Gefitinib as compared to Erlotinib was assessed in 561 postoperative recurrent or stage IIIb/VI patients who had undergone prior chemotherapy treatment but no tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In a subset of patients with sole EGFR L858R, there was an insignificant difference between the objective response and disease control rates for patients treated with erlotinib (N=67) and gefitinib (N=78). Progression free survival was also not significantly different and did not meet the noninferiority endpoint with Gefitinib and Erlotinib arms at 8.1 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR, 0.938; 95% CI, 0.675 to 1.304; P = .704)."
6184,"A Japanese Phase III clinical study assessed the noninferiority of gefitinib in comparison to erlotinib in 561 patients with postoperative or recurrent stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma. Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. Objective response (defined as complete + partial response) was approximately 65 percent for both erlotinib gefitinib and non significantly different (p= .965). Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma."
6186,"A Japanese Phase III clinical study assessed the noninferiority of gefitinib as compared to erlotinib in 561 advanced stage (IIIB and IV) postoperative lung adenocarcinoma patients. All patients had prior chemotherapy but no treatment with TKIs. 19 patients had unspecified uncommon EGFR mutations, including single mutations other than ex19del and L858R and double mutations. Of those 19 patients, 7 were treated with erlotinib and 12 were treated with gefitinib. Objective response (42.9% for erlotinib and 25% for gefitinib) and disease control rate (71.4% with eflotinib and 66.7% with gefitinib) between were not significantly different between the treatments. The study failed to satisfy the primary endpoint of demonstrating statistical noninferiority in PFS of gefitinib."
6273,"In patients with KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) tumors druggable gene fusions have been identified. These alterations included recurrent NRG1 rearrangements predicted to drive PDAC development through aberrant ERBB receptor-mediated signaling, and pharmacologic ERBB inhibition resulted in clinical improvement and remission of liver metastases in two patients with NRG1-rearranged tumors that had proved resistant to standard treatment. One patient (30) was treated with afatinib monotherapy and showed improvement at 7 weeks, followed by progression at 3 months after necessary dose reduction."
6341,"A phase 2 trial on patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part1, NCT01891344) was held to assess PARP inhibitor rucaparib on 3 genetically defined subsets of patients. Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 14 had germline BRCA1 mutation, 13 of which were homozygous mutation and one with unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 86% (12/14) of the germline BRCA1 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients.

6375,"This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803) and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer."
6376,"In this in vitro study, the H1915 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (homozygous for a R351W mutation) was shown to be susceptible to imatinib. This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses."
6377,"This phase II clinical trial of regorafenib (NCT01068769) examined the long term safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who failed previous treatments with imatinib. Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations. 15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2)."

6392,"In this study we report that nonspitzoid metastasizing melanomas of adults may also harbor NTRK fusions and that NTRK expression can be immunohistochemically detected in these tumors. Of 751 melanomas analyzed by next-generation sequencing, 4 metastatic melanomas were identified with NTRK fusions, 3 involving NTRK1 (TRIM63, DDR2, and GON4L), 1 involving NTRK2 (TRAF2). All tumors were cytologically characterized by the presence of large epithelioid melanocytes and were immunoreactive with anti-Trk antibody. The NTRK1-TRIM63 fusion occurred in a 63 yo man with a nodular melanoma with the primary tumor on the shin and skin and lymph node metastases. No known melanoma drivers were identified as co-occurring in this patient. Thus, the presence of an NTRK family fusion in nonspitzoid metastasizing melanomas of adults may provide a therapeutic opportunity for NTRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib in a small subset of patients with metastatic melanoma."

In this manuscript, TRK fusions were screened for in 7,311 patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies. Overall, 8 TRK-fusions were identified including 1 ETV6-NTRK2 fusion in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Treatment with TRK-Inhibitor larotrectinib led to a partial Response in an AML patient with ETV6-NTRK2 fusion after sucessful xenograft studies."
6409,"In this one-arm study, 67 patients with metastastic urothelial carcinoma and diverse FGFR3 alterations were treated with pan-FGFR Inhibitor BGJ398. The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. Four of five patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions had response data, with three achieving stable disease and one having a complete response. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response."

The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK.

6475,"Shukla et al report on a remarkable case study of a 14 year old pediatric patient with refractory secretory breast carcinoma first presenting as a fibroadenoma at 8 yo. Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient."
6567,This was a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients from 4 months to 76 years old with TRK-fusion positive tumors given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types.

6930,"Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion."

The patient had a complex karyotype and microarray revealed a 9p duplication involving JAK2 and deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A. RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT."
7011,5 PAX3-FOXO1 fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines exhibited greater sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibitors than fusion negative lines and introduction of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion to fibroblasts was sufficient to drive an 11 fold increase in sensitivity. The BET inhibitor JQ1 was efficacious in a PAX3-FOXO1 xenograft model.
7016,"The majority of MPNST samples were positive for PARP staining. Overall, moderate to high expression of PARP1 and PARP2 was observed (Table 1)....Overall, treatment continued for 60 d at which point 5 out of 7 mice in the AZD2281 treatment group were alive versus 0 out of 7 mice in the control group (Fig. 4). These results indicated that treatment with AZD2281 significantly increased the survival of mice with metastatic disease."
7018,"In the clinic, compassionate use of the BET inhibitor birabresib (also known as OTX015 or MK-8628) induced rapid tumor regression in 2 of 4 patients with confirmed BRD4-NUTM1 fusions and significant disease stabilization in a third patient. This study provides the first clinical evidence that a BET inhibitor can induce impressive and rapid antitumor activity in this rare and exceptionally aggressive disease."
7021,"A 17-year-old Native American female with B-ALL had persistent MRD at the end of induction. In addition to a complex karyotype, sequencing revealed a novel F694L mutation in JAK2, a p.Cys119_Ile121delinsTrpGlyLeu in IKZF1, and a IGH-CRLF2 translocation, all consistent with BCR-ABL1 like B-ALL. In addition to conventional cytotoxic therapy, the patient was started on 40 mg/m2/day ruxolitinib TKI BID for 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, and MRD diminished to <0.01% prior to allogeneic transplant. The patient was in remission with 100% engraftment from a full match sibling at day 100 post-transplant."
7024,"In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 22 centres in China, patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation, and who had not received previous systemic anticancer therapy, were administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib (83 patients) or gemcitabine plus carboplatin (82 patients). Median progression-free survival was found to be significantly longer with erlotinib than in patients on chemotherapy (13.1 [95% CI 10.58–16.53] vs 4.6 [4.21–5.42] months; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.10–0.26; p<0.0001). Chemotherapy was also associated with more grade 3 or 4 toxic effects. Authors conclude that in patients with advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC, erlotinib offers an improved first line treatment option."
7028,Two patients with EBF1-PDGFRB positive pediatric B-ALL were treated with induction/post-induction therapy and Imatinib. Neither patient experienced disease relapse. One patient died of an undefined encephalopathy at 6 mos post-transplant and the other patient was alive in clinical remission at 10 months after diagnosis.
7066,"In this phase 1 trial, 57 patients with RET fusion- or mutation positive cancers were treated in 7 dose levels. Among patients with RET-Fusion positive NSCLC, objective response rates were 65% (n = 17/26).

7128,"The EBF1-PDGFRB fusion was detected in leukemia cells of a 7 year old Latino boy who presented with B-ALL and initial WBC of 600,000. He failed to enter remission with 4 drug induction (90% blasts at day 23), and showed testicular involvement. SNP array showed deletion of IKZF1 deletion and gains in 5q32 and 5q33.3 that interrupted the PDGFRB and EBF1 loci, respectively. FISH studies demonstrated an extra PDGFRB signal with suspect EBF1-PDGFRB that needs molecular confirmation. Imatinib, cyclophosphamide and etoposide were commenced with MRD 4.3% after 1 month. Imatinib dose was increased with MRD 0.44% after additional month of treatment. MRD was 0.0226% after two months of dasatinib treatment, and the patient proceeded to matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."

7185,"In this retrospective study, the impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on survival in PIK3CA-altered HNSCC patients (N=266) was assessed. 37 of 266 (14%) patients harbored a mutation, 29 of 266 (11%) had only amplification, and 9 patients had both. Among patients with a PIK3CA mutation or amplification, regular NSAID use was significantly associated with disease-specific (HR 0.23, p=0.0032) and overall survival (HR 0.31, p=0.0043). These findings were recreated in a panel of six patient-derived xenograft models, where treatment with NSAIDs (sulindac, Celecoxib or Aspirin) significantly reduced growth rates in PIK3CA mutant, but not wild-type models."
7195,"In a study of 44 signet ring cell colorectal cancer cases, 25% were found to carry a KIT M541L mutation. The authors speculate that this relatively high frequency of KIT mutations (actionable in other cancer types) suggests that imatinib would be a good candidate genomic targeted therapy for this rare cancer subtype."
7199,"This preclinical study proposed to use a combination therapy of an MEK inhibitor (e.g. trametinib) and an mTOR inhibitor (e.g. everolimus) for the treatment of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) with BRAF fusions to evade acquired resistance to MEK targeted therapy. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was identified as a resistance mechanism to MEKi treatment based on RNASeq and GSEA analysis. Using flank xenograft model, mice were injected with NIH3T3 cells expressing KIAA1549-BRAF fusions and treated daily with trametinib, everolimus either alone or combined with each other (n=~10 for each treatment arm). Combination therapy (Trametinib 1mg/kg+ Everolimus 10mg/kg) resulted in better suppression in tumor growth than single-agent treatment. Similarly, combination treatment strongly reduced colony formation as well as pERK and pS6 levels, showing on target effects."
7208,"A 15-year-old girl with B-cell precursor ALL was placed into the very high risk group after showing corticoid resistance on treatment day 8, and induction failure on day 35 (MRD >0.01). The patient received a successful bone marrow transplant and at day 100 showed a complete remission (CR). The patient relapsed 6 months later, and second line therapy was unsuccessful. During this relapse, SNP microarray was performed on the diagnostic sample and identified amplification of 9q34 flanked by the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. Follow-up molecular studies confirmed a NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient was then started on dasatinib in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone. The patient achieved a second CR, and continued on dasatinib until her disease relapsed 2 months later."

7366,"This prospective study reports on the prognosis of patients with B-ALL and an IKZF1 deletion and the impact of intensification of treatment in this subgroup. In 50 patients from the MS2003 cohort, the 5-year cumulative risk for relapse (CIR) associated with IKZF1 deletion was significantly higher than those without the deletion (CIR= 30.4% vs. 8.1%, p=8.7x10^-7). Of those with IKZF1 deletions, the study showed improvement in CIR and CID in both BCR-ABL1 positive, who were treated with imatinib and intensification therapy (CIR decreased from 66.7% to 20%), and BCR-ABL1 negative, who were treated with intensification therapy only (CIR decreased from 20.5% to 11.4%). Overall survival was also significantly improved for patients with IKZF1 deletion in both groups. Intensification therapy was achieved with higher doses of methotrexate 5g/m2, more blocks of delayed intensification, and for HR patients, two fludarabine-cytarabine-daunorubicin blocks. The study was not randomized, did not include IKZF1 mutation status, and did not consider all substratifications of IKZF1."
7369,"In a preclinical trial, multiple experiments testing the effectiveness of ponatinib on the mutation FLT3-ITD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were conducted. Ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation in MV4-11 cell lines (growth inhibition: IC50=2 nmol/L) compared to native FLT3 in RS4;11 cell lines (IC50>100 nmol/L). Additionally, MV4-11 cell lines incubated for 1 hour were shown to have reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases beginning at a ponatinib concentration of 0.3 nmol/L. Ponatinib was shown to induce apoptotic mechanisms measured by caspase-3/7 activity in MV4-cell lines. In mice with the MV4-11 xenograft, ponatinib was very effective in targeting the FLT3-ITD mutation, as dosages of 1-5 mg/kg led to tumor growth inhibition and regression, while dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg led to complete tumor regression. In primary blast cells from AML patients, Ponatinib was selectively effective in growth inhibition of the FLT3-ITD patient cells (n=1, IC50=4nmol/L) when compared to the native FLT3 patient cells (n=3, IC50>100nmol/L)."
7378,"In a preclinical trial, the AML cell line EOL1with the FIP1L1-PDGFRa fusion mutation was treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ponatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib.

7468,"In a phase 3 trial, 572 patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 receptor negative advanced breast cancer who previously received endocrine therapy were allocated to alpelisib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status (N=341). PIK3CA mutation was determined according to the presence or absence of any hot spot mutation in the C2, helical, and kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exon 7, 9, and 20, respectively). In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.65, p<0.001). In the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the HR was 0.85. Analyses of PFS according to mutation types showed consistent benefit of treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant across prespecified subgroups, including E542K, E545X (N=105, HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1), and H1047X."

7483,"Ectopic expression of GOPC–ROS1 in Ba/F3 cells induced cytokine-independent growth whereas overexpression of ROS1 alone did not. Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA). Authors postulated that cell adhesion permitted sufficient to bypass survival signaling."

7492,"Whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were performed on 47 advanced PDAC patients. 3/47 patients were KRAS wildtype and all three of these cases harbored a NRG1 fusion. A 59-year-old metastatic PDAC patient harbored an in-frame fusion of exon 3 of ATP1B1 with exon 2 of NRG1 and no other observed clinically relevant small mutations. Compared to this PDAC cohort, significant overexpression of NRG1 (exons 2-7) was observed in the tumor. Of note, the EGF-like domain of NRG1 (exons 6 & 7), which is required for HER-family kinase activation, is preserved in the fusion. Treatment with afatinib resulted in significant clinical response as measured by imaging, as well as a drastic reduction in CA19-9 levels. Disease progression was noted 5.5 months after treatment initiation."
7493,"Whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were performed on 47 advanced PDAC patients. 3/47 patients were KRAS wildtype and all three of these cases harbored a NRG1 fusion. In a 54-year-old with metastatic PDAC, a complex rearrangement involving the insertion of exons 6 and 7 of NRG1 between exons 15 and 16 of APP was found. This in-frame fusion resulted in the preservation and increased expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1, which is required for HER-family kinase activation. Treatment with afatinib resulted in the resolution of multiple metastases and imaging showed ongoing response 5 months after treatment initiation."
7496,"In this phase 1 dose-escalation study seventy patients with metastatic solid tumours were enrolled. Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3.

Cabozantinib appeared to prolong PFS versus the placebo in the RET mutation-positive subgroup (hazard ratio [HR], 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.38; P < .0001). Patients in a RET mutation-negative population showed relatively smaller benefits from cabozantinib (HR 0.53). The RET M918T subgroup achieved the greatest observed PFS benefit from cabozantinib versus the placebo (HR 0.15)."
7724,"In a case report, a 3‐year‐old girl with glioblastoma harboring a probable germline heterozygous BRCA2 Lys3326Ter (K3326*) nonsense variant. After debulking surgery, the patient received standard‐of‐care treatment with radiation and temozolomide. Nine months later the PARP inhibitor olaparib was administered in combination with temozolomide for 16 cycles. This regimen was well tolerated by the patient and serial imaging showed a reduction in tumor size."
7728,"In this phase 3 trial (ADMIRAL), 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML (required to have FLT3 ITD or TKD D835 or I836 mutations) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (n=247, at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy (n=124). Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy."

7783,"This case report describes a 15 year old patient with relapsed B-ALL positive for the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion, who was successfully treated with chemotherapy with addition of imatinib; the patient remained disease free for 36 months. This case supports sensitivity of B-ALL with RCSD1-ABL1 fusions to ABL-type tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
7787,"A 69 year old patient diagnosed with HNSCC presented with an unresectable neck mass three months after surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance."
7793,"Case Report of a a 56-year-old female (never-smoker) patient with stage IV NSCLC. NGS revealed a MET–ATXN7L1 fusion. No additional known driver gene alterations were identified. Following progression after three months of chemotherapy [paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 days 1 and 8; carboplatin AUC = 5 day 1)], the patient received crizotinib treatment (250 mg/b.i.d. orally) and exhibited a partial response that lasted for 4 months."

7797,"MET exon 14 skipping was modelled in vitro by expressing human MET cDNA with exon 14 deletion in HEK293 cells and mouse MET with homologous exon 15 deletion in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells expressing MET with exon 15 deletion showed dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation upon treatment with capmatinib, with significantly lower cell survival compared to control cells. In addition, HEK293 cells expressing MET with exon 14 deletion had increased ERK phosphorylation, while NIH3T3 cells expressing mouse MET with exon 15 deletion had increased MET phosphorylation and increased anchorage-independent colony formation compared to wt MET."
7798,"CDK4 was found to be significantly overexpressed in the bone marrow of MLL-rearranged B-ALL patients (n=70) compared to normal bone marrow (n=74, p<.001). Combination treatment with dexamethasone (glucocorticoid) and Ribociclib (a highly selective CDK4 / CDK6 inhibitor) of both glucocorticoid sensitive (Rs4;11 & NALM6) and glucocorticoid resistant (RCH-ACV & SEM) B-ALL cell lines synergistically reduced cell viability of all four lines greater than individual drug exposures. Combination therapy also synergistically reduced the cell viability of 5 primary B-ALL lines derived from diagnosis bone marrow compared to individual treatment. (Note: Expression of CDK4 was not quantitatively measured in the derived and primary B-ALL lines used). Further investigation in RCH-ACV and SEM lines revealed dexamethasone and Ribociclib combined increased apoptosis (annexin-V) and increased G1 arrest along with increased p16 (a CDK4 & CDK6 inhibitor) and decreased phosphorylation of downstream G1 to S cell cycle progression markers compared to single treatments. Combination treatment also led to the increase of NR3C1 expression. Knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 by siRNAs in RCH-ACV sensitized these cells to dexamethasone treatment and increased NR3C1 expression."
7800,"In this study twelve GBM cell lines and normal human astrocytes (NHA) were treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. NHA and several GBM cell lines were resistant to palbociclib with IC50 values greater than 1000 nM, while six of seven proneural subtype GBM lines were highly sensitive (IC50 9-210 nM). Palbociclib treatment induced cell accumulation in G1 phase in 3 sensitive proneural lines, but not in 3 resistant lines. Treatment with vehicle versus oral palbociclib (150 mg/kg/day) was compared in mice with intracranial implantation of proneural GBM stem cell-like G448 cells, which are shown to have higher than normal expression of CDK6. Mice receiving palbociclib had significantly longer survival time (p=0.038)."

When comparing potency of these treatments against the 6 CML cell lines, dasatinib, nilotinib and bafetinib were on average 98.6, 9.85 and 16.4 times more potent than imatinib. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay."
7852,"Sequencing of an 8-year old patient diagnosed with a left tentorial-based CNS sarcoma discovered an EWSR1-ATF fusion and IL6 and JAK1 overexpression. Patient was treated with ruxolitinib based on overexpression of JAK1. Stable disease per RECIST and improvement of Lansky score from 60 to 90-100 was observed for 5 months. After ruxolitinib discontinuation, the patient's symptoms worsened and lung lesions progressed. Ruxolitinib was started again per family request and patient again had stable disease and improvement in body weight and Lansky score. Dose reduction was required because of myelosuppression and patient death occurred 23 months after relapse."

7933,"A phase 2 clinical trial studied the efficacy of Crizotinib in East Asian NSCLC patients positive for ROS1 rearrangements (detected by RT-PCR AmoyDx assay) and negative for ALK1 rearrangements. Of the 127 patients enrolled, 17 achieved complete response and 74 achieved partial response. Overall response rate by independent radiology review was 71.7% (95% CI 63-79.3%) Time to response was rapid (median 1.9 months) and durable (Duration of response median 19.7 months). Median progression free survival was 15.9 months. Crizotinib was clinically beneficial regardless of demographics and prior therapy. Based on these results, Crizotinib was approved for the treatment of ROS1 positive NSCLC in 2017 in Japan, Taiwan, China, and Korea."
7988,"A high-throughput screen of 637 cancer cell lines revealed 2 to be sensitive to the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. The most highly sensitive line was A-204, a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. A-204 was then compared to a panel of 6 other rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and was the only one of the 7 with detectable PDGFRA protein (Western) and to demonstrate sensitivity to sunitinib. In A-204, no PDGFRA gene amplification was detected by FISH, but qPCR revealed a an increased PDGFRA mRNA expression. Reduction of PDFGRA expression by shRNA decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment. Additionally, targeting the PDGFRA ligand, PDGFC, with shRNA or antibody decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment."
7990,"A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target."
7991,"A 37-year-old man presented with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis."

7993,"Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A)."
7994,"Two AML cell lines, IMS-M2 and M0-91, with the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion were treated with entrectinib. Sequencing of these cell lines found no other driver mutations in 265 other cancer genes suggesting the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion is the oncogenic driver. The IC50 for the IMS-M2 and M0-91 cell lines was 0.47 and 0.65 nmol/L, respectively. Mouse xenografts treated with entrectinib at 10 or 30 mg/kg had complete remission while treatment with 3 mg/kg caused significant reduction in tumor growth. Testing of the bone marrow of IMS-M2 xenografts after 3 weeks of treatment found no human CD45-positive cells in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg treatment groups; all vehicle treated mice had some human CD45-positive cells in their bone marrow.

8042,"A healthy 12 year old with right neck mass was found to have heterogeneous solid mass originating from the right thyroid lobe. Total thyroidectomy confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with multiple involved lymph nodes. Following radioactive iodine treatment and further resection after relapse, the patient was found to have multiple pulmonary nodules. Genome and transcriptome sequencing were performed on debulked tissue and archival sample revealing a fusion between TPM3 exon 8 and NTRK1 exon 9, which was validated by PCR. In addition, NTRK1 had extremely high expression relative to TCGA thyroid cancer samples and Illumina BodyMap normal thyroid tissue. The patient received larotrectinib on a phase I/II study (NCT02637687), showing improvement on CT scans after just two cycles of therapy, and remains on therapy after 10 months with almost complete resolution of pulmonary modules and excellent performance status."
8106,"Gilteritinib inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y (IC50 1.6 nM; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4 nM) compared to controls (IC50 420nM; 95% CI: 350–500 nM). Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation."
8108,"A 35 year-old male patient (AML4) presented with a FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis and was refractory to induction and salvage chemotherapy. He then received quizartinib and underwent allogenic transplant, but relapsed after 6 months. He then responded to sorafenib, but had disease progression with a FLT3-D835Y mutation. The patient derived relapse sample containing ITD and D835Y mutations was sensitive to gilteritinib based on cytotoxicity assays using MTT. Additionally, immunoblot demonstrated gilteritinib reduced FLT3 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing only D835Y with an IC50 of 1.4 nM."

8260,"A 9 year old girl with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma (2016 WHO) relapsed 15 months post-maintenance chemotherapy. FISH and genomic analysis detected the EBF1-PDGFRB fusion (exon 11 with Exon14). The patient was treated with induction [fludarabine, idarubicin and cytarabine] therapy followed by additional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI, imatinib). Imatinib was stopped 10 days before cord blood transplant (CBT) with reduced intensity conditional and re-initiated on day 47 until 12 months post-transplant. The EBF1-PDGFRB transcript level measured using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remained below detection limit (<2.5x102 copies/ microgram RNA) for 36 months post CBT. Furthermore, the patient maintained molecular remission during the 24 months post-CBT and the 12 months following completion of TKI administration, based on minimal residual disease (MRD) testing conducted every 6 months."

The study found that dactolisib and lapatinib were effective in inhibiting outgrowth of PIK3CA amplified cells as monotherapies. Combination therapy produced similar abrogation of growth for PIK3CA amplified cells. Additionally, growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of lapatinib or dactolisib."

Cytotoxicity assessed by MTT demonstrated Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3/ITD Y842C treated with Lestaurtinib responded similarly to FLT3/ITD control cells (IC50: 2nM). Immunoblotting revealed Lestaurtinib inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation and the activation of downstream pathways in Ba/F3 FLT3/ITD Y842C and control cells. These FLT3/ITD Y842C cells also responded to Lestaurtinib treatment in vivo after transplantation into Balb/c mice as measured by minimal bioluminescence and reduced spleen weight compared to vehicle and sorafenib treated mice.
8340,"A screen using saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected TF1 cells in FLT3 TKIs identified Y842C. Cytotoxicity assessed by MTT demonstrated Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3/ITD Y842C treated with Midostaurin responded similarly to FLT3/ITD control cells (IC50: 4nM). Like in FLT3/ITD control cells, immunoblotting showed Midostaurin inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation and the activation of downstream pathways in Ba/F3 FLT3/ITD Y842C cells."
8351,"A 62-year-old female patient (AML5) was refractory to conventional chemotherapy and developed disease progression to quizartinib due to a D835I mutation. Using MTT to measure cytotoxicity, gilteritinib inhibited this patient’s relapse sample. Additionally, immunoblot demonstrated gilteritinib inhibited FLT3 phosphoryaltion at a concentration of 20 nM in the patient dereivd relapse cells."
8364,"Resistance of RKO cells, which harbor BRAF V600E (a known vemurafenib sensitizing mutation) and PIK3CA H1047R, to vemurafenib monotherapy was abrogated by the addition of pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, vemurafenib and MK-2206 combination treatment of RKO cells resulted in substantially greater proliferation inhibition than either agent in isolation or untreated control cells (combination index score = 0.691 at EC50). Synergistic effects of vemurafenib and MK-2206 on RKO cells was confirmed in vivo via xenografts on an athymic mouse model, where mice treated with vemurafenib monotherapy experienced minimal tumor growth inhibition (25%), mice treated with MK-2206 monotherapy experienced modest tumor growth inhibition (37%), and mice treated with both achieved 87% tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle treated control mice (P <0.001)."
8374,"In a case study of a metastatic melanoma with a GOLGA4-RAF1 fusion, the patient was administered MEK inhibitor therapy in the absence of other actionable variants. This resulted in a profound and clinically significant response. The study demonstrated that GOLGA4-RAF1 expression was associated with ERK activation, elevated expression of the RAS/RAF downstream coeffector ETV5, and a high Ki67 index. These findings provide a rationale for the dramatic response to targeted therapy."
8504,"This randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluated the PARP inhibitor olaparib in 387 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). The study found that in men with mCRPC who had somatic or germline deleterious alterations (irrespective of zygosity) in any of the following HRR genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRIP1, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L), olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone (PFS HR 0.49 [0.38, 0.63]). A total of 8 patients had PALB2 mutations, 4 in each arm. Based on the results of this study, on May 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib (LYNPARZA) for adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated mCRPC, who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone."

8506,"This in vivo study examined the efficacy of various treatments on athymic nude mice xenografted with colorectal cancer HT29 cells, which harbor BRAF V600E. The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Irinotecan, cetuximab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in >100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 250% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Of the ten treated mice, nine experienced partial response and one experienced a complete response. Compared to all doublet and single agent combinations of vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab, triplet therapy produced the best TGI and ILS (p<0.05, p <0.0001 for all comparisons)."

8657,"A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%)."
8773,"Post hoc analysis of a randomized phase 3 trial (MILO/ENGOT-ov11) suggests a possible association between KRAS mutation and response to binimetinib in patients with pretreated (1-3 lines of prior chemotherapy) recurrent or persistent Low-Grade Serous Carcinomas of the Ovary, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneum. Of 133 binimetinib-treated patients with individual response and molecular data, 46 harbored KRAS mutations. KRAS mutation status was significantly associated with local best response (P=0.004); 44% of patients with KRAS mutation versus 19% of patients with KRAS WT had CR or PR in the binimetinib arm. KRAS mutation was also associated with prolonged PFS in patients treated with binimetinib (median PFS: KRAS mutant: 17.7 months; KRAS wild-type (WT): 10.8 months; P = .006), but not in patients receiving standard chemotherapy (physicians' choice, median PFS: KRAS mutant: 14.6 months; KRAS WT: 11.5 months; P=.502)."
8842,"In phase 3 trial of 387 patients comparing olaparib and new hormonal agent (enzalutamide or abiraterone) therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer harboring homologous recombinant repair-related gene mutation detected from a tumor sample, olaparib showed significant PFS benefit in an ITT population (HR [95%CI] 0.49 [0.38, 0.63]). But in subgroup analysis, the treatment effect differed in each mutated genes. Among them, patients with BRCA2 mutations (olaparib: n=92, control: n=53) showed a prominent benefit of olaparib (PFS HR [95%CI] 0.21 [0.13, 0.32])."
8847,"In a phase 2 trial, a total of 364 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and MET alterations were assigned to cohorts based on prior treatment and type of MET alteration. A total of 97 patients, from cohorts 4 (pretreated) and 5b (no previous treatment), had MET exon 14 skipping mutations. Among pretreated (1-2 lines of therapy) patients with NSCLC with a MET exon 14 skipping mutation, overall response was observed in 41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 53) of 69 patients. Overall response rate was 68% (95% CI, 48 to 84) of 28 patients who had not received treatment previously.

Three of 7 patients showed response. Of these: 2 patients achieved complete remission (1 of which was mutated for IDH2). One patient with IDH1 mutation showed PB blast clearance (derived anti-leukemic benefit) but BM was not performed to evaluate response. Venetoclax responders had high BCL‐2 and/or BIM expression levels in myeloblasts, and the response was significantly associated with OS. BCL-2 and BIM expression levels can potentially identifer venetoclax responders."

8865,"In a pediatric phase 1 trial (NCT02637687), a 2 year old with infantile fibrosarcoma of the shoulder harbored the SQSTM1-NTRK1 fusion. After two surgical resections and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, Larotrectinib treatment resulted in 93% tumour reduction. An R1 resection was performed followed by adjuvant Larotrectinib. The patient remained on Larotrectinib without evidence of disease progression at the time of last follow-up."
8878,"A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months."
8900,"After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months."
8902,"A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later."
8917,"All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration."
8923,"This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells."
8924,"In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001)."

9018,"Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2)."

Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay."
9159,"Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with break-apart probes, the authors screened retrospectively 55 pediatric and 50 adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases negative for common drivers (B-other) for rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2 and PDGFRB tyrosine kinase genes. Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL."
9164,"Authors reported a 40-yr-old male patient with pre-B ALL and t(1;9)(q24;q34) translocation. Two different RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcripts, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, were identified, one consisting of the first three exons of RCSD1 fused to ABL1 starting from exon 4, the second of the first two exons of RCSD1 fused to exon 4 of ABL1. The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy. The patient successfully reentered in CCyR, which has been maintained with dasatinib monotherapy for more than nine months."
9165,"Authors reported a 15-year-old female patient with B-ALL diagnosed in June 2014. Conventional cytogenetics and FISH identified t(1;9)(q23;q34) and RCSD1ABL1 fusion. Microarray identified an approximately 70 kb deletion at 7p12.2 disrupting the IKZF1 gene. The patient was enrolled on AALL-1131 and received a 4-drug induction therapy with Vincristine/Daunorubicin/Pegaspargase/Prednisone. Her day 8 peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing showed 18–25% blasts and her day 29 bone marrow evaluation revealed induction failure. She continued chemotherapy per the very high-risk control arm of AALL-1131 with the addition of dasatinib due to the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion. Her consolidation course was complicated due to presumed fungal infection and C. difficile colitis, but she was able to complete the consolidation treatment. The last bone marrow done on November 2014 showed no evidence of persistent/recurrent leukemia. The patient had a bone marrow transplant from a sibling in November 2014, but a few weeks after transplant she developed severe sepsis as well as capillary leak syndrome. She remained admitted to the intensive care unit where she unfortunately died on March 12, 2015."
9168,"Authors reported a 61-year old female diagnosed with B-ALL in August 2012. The RCSD1-ABL1 t(1;9)(q22;q34) fusion between exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1 was identified by RT-PCR. The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully. Since then, there is an ongoing remission that, to date, has lasted 30 months."
9169,"Authors reported a 15-year-old female diagnosed with B-ALL with the t(1;9)(q24;q34.1). RNAseq data were consistent with a fusion between the exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1, resulting in the formation of an in-frame RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcript. The patient achieved complete remission upon addition of TKIs to the post-induction chemotherapy regimen, but developed fatal complications after HSCT."
9171,"A 4-year-old female presented with relapsed B-cell precursor ALL and no MLL or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement per cytogenetic studies. During multiple periods of short remission and relapse she was treated with high risk induction chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation and matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Finally, WES and RNA-seq were performed on the tumor and normal samples, which identified a cryptic ETV6-ABL1 fusion as well as a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. She was administered imatinib and achieved a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission, which were maintained for 18 months. After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D). Treatments of Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Panobinostat were unsuccessful and the patient ultimately succumbed to her disease 7 year after her initial diagnosis."
9211,"This retrospective study reported the outcome of 24 patients with Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) harboring ABL-class fusions, who were treated with a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1; in 7/12 patients the ABL1 fusion was detected at diagnosis, and in 5/12 it was identified at relapse. One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3). However, the patient experienced another relapse and died of progressive disease. The case illustrates partial response to TKIs in combination with chemotherapy in a relapsed Ph-like B-ALL with RANBP2-ABL1 fusion."
9213,"Authors reported a 26 year-old female patient with B-ALL and RCSD1-ABL1 fusion identified by FISH and PCR. Sequencing showed that RCSD1 exon 3 was fused to ABL1 exon 4. This patient was treated with chemotherapy and HSC transplant and relapsed. Ex vivo drug response profiling (DRP) of the patient leukemic blasts was performed at first relapse. Resistance and/or low response were observed for dasatinib and nilotinib, and measurable responses were noted to ponatinib. This differential response to ponatinib as compared with dasatinib was confirmed in a secondary dose-response study and in mice inoculated with leukemia cells. Then the patient was started on ponatinib monotherapy (45 mg/day) based on her RCSD1-ABL1 fusion and achieved a remission. She received a second HSC transplant but relapsed at day 77 post transplantation. Ponatinib was restarted at this time that resulted in response but didn’t reach remission. The patient died of a septic shock 2 weeks later."
9220,"In a retrospective study of 2316 Chinese patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, a 63 year old female with the EGFR exon 20 insertion A767_V769dupASV received osimertinib as first-line treatment. The patient achieved a partial response with greater than 30% reduction in tumour size, and progression-free survival of 6.0 months."
9221,"In a retrospective study of 2316 Chinese patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, a 69 year old male with the novel EGFR exon 20 insertion N771_P772insL received osimertinib as first-line treatment. The patient achieved stable disease as best response with greater than 10% reduction in tumour size, and progression-free survival of 4.9 months."
9223,"In a retrospective study of 2316 Chinese patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, a 63 year old female with the EGFR exon 20 insertion D770_N771insG received osimertinib as second-line treatment. The patient had clinical improvement and achieved partial response with nearly 50% reduction in tumour size. Progression-free survival was 6.4 months."
9224,"In a retrospective study of 2316 Chinese patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, two patients with the EGFR exon 20 insertion S768_D770dup received osimertinib treatment. A 59 year old female with previous systemic treatment had a partial response and progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.6+ months, remaining on osimertinib at data cut-off. The second patient, a 70 year old female, had previous systemic therapy and treatment with the EGFR inhibitor afatinib. This patient also remained on treatment at data cut-off with stable disease and PFS of 11.2+ months."
9225,"In a retrospective study of 2316 Chinese patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, a 65 year old female with the EGFR exon 20 insertion A763_Y764insFQEA received osimertinib as second-line treatment. The patient achieved a partial response with greater than 50% reduction in tumour size, and progression-free survival of 5.1 months. The patient had previously achieved partial response on gefinitib, but experienced disease progression after 9.0 months at which point a rebiopsy was found to harbor a T790M mutation."
9228,"A 33 year old M non-smoker with no cancer family history and no known exposure to asbestos showed weakness, chest pain, and plural effusion (PE) accumulation. Mass in right lung was seen under enhanced CT. Patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB (cT4N2M0) malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) using National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on MPM staging (v.1.2018). Patient was given palliative chemotherapy for two cycles, which reduced the PE and improved physical mobility. Targeted NGS panel with 520 genes of PE showed EML4::ALK variant 3 (allelic fraction 24.21%). After 1 month symptoms were alleviated and NGS showed reduced EML4::ALK abundance (allelic fraction 8.22%). After 2 months CT showed tumor shrinkage. This was evaluated as partial response."
9239,"Transgenic mice were generated with conditional knockouts affecting exon 18 of the mouse ATRX gene, previously shown to be an equivalent of a loss of function. Macrophages derived from the knockout mice were significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (P<0.05) compared to macrophages derived from wild-type mice, as demonstrated by reduced survival by TUNEL assays. Re-introduction of ATRX rescued cells from 5-FU treatment. Similar significant (P<0.05) increases in TUNEL-positive cells were seen for ATRX-deficient neurons treated with 5-FU, as well as myoblasts and embryonic fibroblasts treated with 5-FU or cisplatin. The authors conclude that ATRX loss leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents."
9339,"R1032Q affects the gene's universal kinase catalytic motif. The authors found that injection of mice with COLO-320 cells that harbor this mutation resulted in tumor generation, indicating that this mutation could have oncogenic potential. In vitro kinase assays showed R1032Q reduced VEGFR2 kinase activity. Using proliferation studies with the COLO-320 cell-line, the authors observed sensitivity to 4 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment of the MDST8 colorectal cancer cell line carrying the R1032Q mutation with cabozantinib resulted in significant reduction in cell growth and increased ERK phosphorylation levels."
9360,"This study describes a cohort of 24 patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL and ABL-class kinase rearrangement exposed to TKI frontline or at relapse, who showed favorable MRD response and outcome. Specifically, one 34-year-old man with MEF2D-CSF1R identified by RNAseq was prescribed an unspecified dose of imatinib as adjuvant to his frontline chemotherapy (protocol GRAALL-2014). His initial MRD analysis at 94 days remained positive for blasts (1 x 10^-4), but was consistent with continuous complete remission (CCR) at day 147. Although he achieved CCR with chemotherapy and imatinib, the patient's disease eventually recurred and he died in the first relapse."
9377,"A phase I safety and dose-escalation study (NCT01897571) was completed for tazemetostat in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or advanced solid tumors. Durable objective responses, including complete responses, were observed in eight (38%) of 21 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and two (5%) of 43 patients with solid tumours. EZH2 mutation status was assessed retrospectively. Two DLBCL patients had mutations. One of these (with a Y646H mutation) had a durable partial response before disease progression after 16 months on study. The variant in the second patient was not reported and the duration of therapy for this patient that did not respond was among the shortest in the trial."
9404,"This case reports a 16-mo-old boy with metastatic neuroblastoma (stage M). Genomic analysis of a diagnostic biopsy of the tumor and matched normal identified two germline mutations in FANCA and somatic ALK-I1171T mutation. Functional investigation of this mutation including PC12 cell neurite outgrowth, NIH3T3 transformation and phosophoproteomics showing increased ALK signaling all suggested that it was a gain function. The patient was treated with Ceritinib as a monotherapy for 7.5 months. The residual primary decreased in size (44% volume reduction at 6 months of treatment) and was surgically removed. At 21 months of followup a complete remission was observed (including all metastatic sites)."
9431,"The phase II cohort of the CodeBreaK 100 study (NCT03600883) investigated the activity of the KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib in previously treated patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. A total of 124 patients had measurable disease and were evaluated for response by independent central review. Complete response was seen in four patients and partial response in 42 patients, for an objective response rate of 37.1% (95% CI, 28.6 to 46.2). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.8 (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2) months and 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.0 to could not be evaluated), respectively."
9588,"One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions."
9632,4 of 16 patients with urothelial carcinoma harboring HRAS hotspot point mutations and 1 patient with an HRAS frameshift insertion had a partial response to the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib while none of the 6 patients with wild-type HRAS responded.
9633,"In a phase II HNSCC trial, an objective response rate of 55% was seen in HRAS-mutant patients (11 of 20) treated with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib with a PFS of 5.6 months and an OS of 15.6 months (providing the allele fraction was at least 20%)."
9697,"Ba/F3 cells expressing ERBB2 V777L were treated with lapatinib and showed an IC50 value of 27nM, compared to 30nM for wild-type ERBB2 cells. The authors considered V777L as lapatinib-sensitive."
9709,Tazemetostat was found to have increased anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma with gain-of-function EZH2 mutations (cobas EZH2 Mutation Test; objective response rate of 69%) versus patients with wild-type EZH2 (objective response rate of 35%). Treatment shows good tolerability and durability of response in both groups of patients.
9778,"From a phase one clinical trial, pediatric patients with refractory CNS malignancies were administered 300-1150 mg/m2 twice daily of ERBB2 and EGFR inhibitor lapatinib. The maximum-tolerated dose was established at 900 mg/m2 twice daily, regardless of steroid use. From the 59 patients, 12 patients, including 5 diagnosed with ependymoma, demonstrated a prolonged stable disease in response to lapatinib. In comparison to other CNS tumors, pretrial samples from patients with ependymoma tumors displayed high expression of ERBB2 and activation of ERBB2 signaling. Due to the high expression of ERBB2 receptors, targeting ERBB2 may be a viable treatment for patients with ependymoma tumors and other high expressing ERBB2 brain tumors."
9851,"The open-label phase 3 BEACON CRC trial included 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic CRC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators’ choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI. The median overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to 11.0) in the doublet-therapy group and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.6) in the control group, with a significantly lower risk of death compared to the control group (hazard ratio for death doublet-group vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group, 20% in the doublet-therapy group (95% CI 13 to 29) and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (doublet group vs. control P<0.001). Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) in the doublet-therapy group, and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression doublet-group vs control, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52, P<0.001)."
10066,"In an in vitro study, a Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR G598V demonstrated increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment, compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR wild-type. Variant function was assessed by EGFR auto-phosphorylation. Sensitivity was assessed by cell viability assay using stable transfection of each variant and increasing concentrations of erlotinib (0–10 uM)."
10094,BaF3 cells transduced with a number of NTRK fusions demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib. IC50 values were measured from cell viability assays (Cell Titer Glo) following 72-hour incubation with entrectinib. The TPM3::NTRK1 BaF3 cell line (2.5nM) was more sensitive than the BaF3 control (>1000nM). The authors conclude that entrectinib has potent in vitro activity against multiple NTRK fusions including TPM3::NTRK1.

10138,"A randomized phase III trial of hormone sensitive (ER or PR positive) early stage breast cancer (Dutch TEAM cohort, n=2,446) examined the addition of metformin to exemestane for 155 patients. IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm).

10360,"An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizures revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity."
10361,"An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response."
10392,A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.
10635,"Of 351 primary thyroid carcinoma patients assessed by targeted gene rearrangement next-generation assay, 11 cases (3.1%) had NTRK rearrangement. Only one case of EML4::NTRK3 fusion (e2,e13) with an intact kinase domain was detected in an intracranial metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment at initial diagnosis. However, disease persisted and after three decades brain metastasis occurred. NTRK inhibitor therapy was given which showed a 69.7% decrease in disease burden following 34 cycles of entrectinib (400 mg daily) with mild side effects. pTERT C228T mutation and the frameshift MEN1 deletion cooccurred with EML4::NTRK3 fusion and both did not confer to entrectinib resistance."
10636,"The paper mentions a 43-year-old-male with an EML4::NTRK3 rearrangement in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer initially treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Upon identification of an EML4::NTRK3 fusion, the patient was treated with the NTRK inhibitor entrectinib for 12 months with a partial response."
10840,"A 23 month old (at the time of report) male was diagnosed prenatally with Stage II cellular mesoblastic nephroma (MN) on the right kidney, which was surgically removed on the sixth day of life. ETV6::NTRK was found by FISH. At 12 months a lesion on the distal tibia developed. The patient entered the larotrectinib pediatric study NCT02637687 and received eight cycles of therapy without any grade 2 or greater toxicities so far. After this the patient had a full range of motion in the lower extremity and the there was a complete disappearance of the soft-tissue component and a near-complete reconstitution of the cortex of the distal right tibial metastatic focus."
10886,"The multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 study included patients with IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma who had progressed on previous therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to Ivosidenib or placebo. Placebo to Ivosidenib crossover was permitted on radiological progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by independent central review. Progression-free survival was significantly improved with Ivosidenib compared with the placebo (median 2.7, vs 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.37; 95% CI 0.25-0.54; one-side p<0.0001). Median overall survival was 10.8 months for the Ivosidenib group versus 9.7 months for the placebo group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.44-1.10]; p=0.060) in which 35 patients were crossover from the placebo group. In a prespecified exploratory analysis, the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method was used to reconstruct the survival curve for patients receiving a placebo as if crossover had never occurred. RPSFT assumes that the treatment effect is the same for all patients, regardless of when the treatment is given. The RPSFT-adjusted median overall survival was 6.0 months for the placebo group (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.28-0.75]; p=0.0008)."
10913,"Case report describing a 63-year-old patient with colorectal adenocarcinoma. He started treatment with XELOX and bevacizumab. After findings of disease progression, they changed to bevacizumab and FOLFIRI. They detected EGFR::SEPT14 fusion (exon 24 & exon 10) and EGFR amplification by NGS on a paraffin sample after discontinuing the treatment due to complications. The tumor was microsatellite stable. The patient started treatment with erlotinib with signs of partial response (CT scan) 20 days later. A couple months later the patient showed signs of progressive disease, but a new variant, EGFRvIII (deletion of Exons 2-7), was detected in the mediastinal lymph nodes sample tested that likely contributed to erolotinib resistance."
10996,"A metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (bone and brain) was diagnosed in a 42-year-old woman (patient 3). The primary adenocarcinoma was found in left lower lobe (LLL). Her initial treatment with whole-brain radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in a partial response. During her chemotherapy, the tumor biopsy sample was sent for NGS testing and found to harbor an EGFR rearrangement at the exon 25, resulting in the formation of a fusion gene between EGFR and PURB genes. She was treated with erlotinib, resulting in a 48% decrease in the LLL index lesion, ongoing for 20 months."
11015,"The paper reports three patients (P1, P2 and P4) with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis, harboring the EGFR::RAD51 fusion detected by hybrid capture NGS (FoundationOne). Breakpoints were in intron 24 of EGFR and intron3 of RAD51. These patients were not amenable to systemic chemotherapy due to disseminated intravascular coagulation or DIC (P1 and P2) or showed disease progression following chemotherapy (P4), and were subsequently treated with the EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib. Noticeable clinical and functional improvements were seen, including regression of miliary nodules, reduction in tumor size and resolution of DIC."
11021,"Case report of a 30- year-old male with lung adenocarcinoma , with metastasis to several organs, including several lesions in the brain. NGS assay (Foundation One CDX panel) detected the EGRF::RAD51 fusion. He was treated with platinum -based agents and palliative radiation therapy to the spine. Once the disease was stable as per RECIST guidelines, treatment was switched to Osimertinib. Marked improvement was seen within two weeks with reduction in lymph node metastases and reduction in back pain. Dramatic reductions in brain lesions were observed after 2 months of treatment (Fig 1 and Fig 2). The patient was followed up for 9 months during which significant improvement was seen in his clinical status, and he continued to remain on this therapy. The authors have also noted that osimertinib fared better in improving his CNS symptoms compared to his earlier chemotherapy treatment."
11026,"Case report of a 50-year-old male with Stage 1 Lung adenocarcinoma. NGS detected the presence of KIF5B::EGFR fusion (exon 15 and exon 18). The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy but experienced disease progression to lymph nodes and left rib after 13 months. The lymph nodes showed both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. He was then treated with afatinib and showed progression-free survival for 11 months, after which intracranial metastasis was observed, and treatment with afatinib was discontinued. Following a whole brain radiation therapy, the patient was treated with Osimertinib for 4 months due to the detection of a known resistance marker T790M, however only a limited benefit was seen and the treatment was discontinued. The authors conclude the detection of the novel KIF5B-EGFR fusion in advanced NSCLC was a good indicator of response to afatinib."
11027,"Several splicing factors known to drive myeloid neoplasms (including SRSF2) require phosphorylation by CLK family kinases for nuclear translocation. The authors describe development of an inhibiter of a CLK family kinase called CTX-712 and evaluate its efficacy in cell line and murine models. CTX-712 efficacy was confirmed in MDS/AML-derived xenografts (PDX). One PDX model with an SRSF2 P95L variant exhibited significant reduction in tumor volume 2 weeks after CTX-712 high dose treatment compared to vehicle (P=0.0162, N=6). CTX-712 treatment also improved survival in the SRSF2 P95L-mutated model (P=0.0030, N=6 mice)."
11028,Several splicing factors known to drive myeloid neoplasms (including SRSF2) require phosphorylation by CLK family kinases for nuclear translocation. The authors describe development of an inhibiter of a CLK family kinase called CTX-712 and evaluate its efficacy in cell line and murine models. CTX-712 efficacy was confirmed in MDS/AML-derived xenografts (PDX). One PDX model with an SRSF2 P95H variant showed a significant response to CTX-712 in a dose-dependent manner. 4 out of 5 mice receiving a high dose protocol achieved complete remission. CLK inhibition also induced aberrant splicing events including skipped exons and this effect was more prevalent in the SRSF2-mutated model.
11099,"A 45-year-old non-smoking female patient was diagnosed with a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple brain metastases. Targeted NGS analysis on the pleural biopsy using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 panel identified the EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion. This fusion was confirmed by both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using NTRK3 and EML4 Dual Color Break Apart probes and panTRK antibody IHC staining. Entrectinib was started and two months later PET scan and brain MR revealed partial response. After 5 months of treatment, complete response was observed in the lungs and brain. As of publication, the patient was still being treated with entrectinib, and their most recent PET and MR scan taken 1 year and 5 months into treatment demonstrated maintained complete response in the brain and lungs."
11100,"A 7 month old male had a large cystic mass in his brain surgically resected. Pathological analysis determined the mass to be an infantile high-grade glioma and transcriptome sequencing of the tumor RNA found the tumor harbored an EML4::NTRK3 fusion. The patient then went through four cycles of chemotherapy, but imaging taken two months later revealed no change in tumor size. The patient was treated with Larotrectinib (100 mg/m2/dose BID) and an MRI two months later demonstrated a significant decrease of his tumor. The patient (now 17 months old) continues on twice daily larotrectinib and shows no signs of progression after 10 months of treatment."
11107,"In this phase I study, four Japanese patients with follicular lymphoma were recruited to test the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitor-Tazemetostat. Patients were screened for presence of EZH2 mutations and only one patient had an activating mutation in EZH2. The patients were treated with Tazemetostat at a dose of 800 mg twice a day. Three of the four patients had partial response (including the one with the activating mutation), while one had a stable disease status after the treatment cycle. The authors highlight the treatment's acceptable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas."
11108,"In this phase I study, one patient with germinal center B‐cell‐like (GCB) DLBCL and two with non-GCB DLBCL types were recruited to test the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitor-Tazemetostat in Japanese patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell lymphomas. The patients were treated with a dose of 800 mg twice a day and an objective response was reached only in the patient with the GCB-DLBCL type (complete response), while the other two had progressive disease status. Since EZH2 is known to be expressed in GC and have a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation, the authors speculate that the the cellular origin of DLBCL might be a key in predicting the efficacy of Tazemetostat."
11109,"This phase II study involved 17 Japanese adult patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), previously treated with chemotherapy without an available standard therapy. The patients harbored EZH2 activating mutations and were recruited to test the efficacy and safety of the EZH2 inhibitor- Tazemetostat. Tazemetostat was given at 800 mg dose twice a day for 28-days cycle. The objective response rate in this cohort was 76.5%, including six patients who had a complete response and seven who had partial response. The remaining three patients had stable disease status. Finally, the median progression‐free survival was not reached at the median follow‐up of 12.9 months. The authors highlight the efficacy and manageable safety profile of Tazemetostat in refractory/relapsed FL."
11113,"This case report describes a 33 year-old non-smoker with no known exposure to asbestos who was diagnosed with stage IIIB malignant pleural mesothelioma. Panel next generation sequencing (NGS) of 520 genes revealed an EML4::ALK fusion and the patient was subsequently treated with alectinib. After 1 month of therapy the patient showed clinical improvement, and plasma NGS revealed a decrease in EML4::ALK allele fraction (AF) from 24.21% to 8.22%. Progressive disease was confirmed after 4.5 months of alectinib therapy at which time plasma NGS revealed the emergence of two acquired resistance mutations, I1171N (AF=4.24%) and L1196M (AF=0.33). He then received lorlatinib and achieved a PR within one month with 34% tumour shrinkage, suggesting lorlatinib sensitivity despite compound I1171N and L1196M acquired mutations. He began showing signs of progression after 3.6 months of lorlatinib treatment and plasma NGS at that time identified a third concurrent acquired resistance mutation G1202R (AF=3.07%) in cis with L1196M."

SQSTM1::NTRK1 fusion was identified via RNA sequencing and confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization. After fusion identification, larotrectinib was started (100mg, twice daily). CT scan 2.5 months after starting treatment showed partial response by CT scan RECIST 1.1 measurements (−43%). After 18 months of larotrectinib treatment, a tumor reduction burden of 51% was observed. At the time of publication, treatment was still ongoing."
11578,"A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months."

11692,"The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancers. This was achieved by reviewing data from two global, multicenter clinical trials of patients treated with larotrectinib: a phase II adult and young adult basket trial (NCT02576431) and a phase I adult trial (NCT02122913). The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively. Of the total of 20 NTRK-fusions positive lung cancer cases, 6 had TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, but detailed response information was only provided for one TPM3::NTRK1 positive case. This patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer which previously progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy after 9 months and on the PD-1 inhibitor dostarlimab after 2 months. A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control. The authors concluded that larotrectinib was highly active with rapid and durable responses, extended survival benefit, and a favorable long-term safety profile in patients with advanced lung cancer harboring NTRK gene fusions, including the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion."
11703,"This was a Phase 1/2 study in which 55 patients between 4 months and 76 years of age with TRK-fusion positive tumors were given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types. There were 9 patients with tumors of different histologies which were positive for the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion. Overall response rate in the study was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. 7 out of 9 patients with TPM3::NTRK1 positive tumors showed response, of which 2 had pathologic remission. Authors stated that Larotrectinib had durable antitumor activity for tumors positive for NTRK-fusions (including TPM3::NTRK1) regardless of age or tumor type."
11706,"A female patient, 43 presented with right lower quadrant pain, and was surgically treated for perforated appendicitis including segmental small-bowel resection. Invasive adenocarcinoma stage IIB (pT4aN0) of the cecum was identified in the pathology, with intact MMR. The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy. A year later the patient showed recurrence of the tumor mass consistent with stage IV recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer. Testing revealed the tumor to be MSI-High. TPR-NTRK1 was found in the tumor by NGS and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was found (39 mutations/Mb). Pembrolizumab was given (four cycles), but patient progressed. Combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab and nivolumab was then given, followed by further progression. Patient was then given NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib and after 5 weeks a considerable decrease in the size of peritoneal metastasis was seen, accompanied by other tumor shrinkage and remarkable improvement of symptoms. Curative-intent surgical resection of the tumor mass was performed, and adjuvant larotrectinib was declined. No evidence of tumor was apparent after 26 months."
11708,"In this study, 331 patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 gliomas were either given vorasidenib (n = 168) or a placebo (n = 163). A median PFS of 27.7 months was reported in the vorasidenib group, compared to 11.1 months in the group given a placebo. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.27-0.56; p<0.001). Additionally, a lower time to the next intervention was noted in the vorasidenib group compared to the placebo group. Grade 3 or higher adverse effects were noted in 22.8% of the patients in the treatment group, which may likely be related to the vorasidenib treatment. Overall, vorasidenib significantly improved PFS and delayed the time to the next intervention in the treatment group, compared to the control group (placebo group)."
11709,"In this trial involving 500 patients, 188 individuals received treatment with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors. Among them, 106 patients had tumors containing TP53 mutations. The analysis revealed a higher rate of overall improvement, encompassing stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), and complete remission (CR), at 31% for those treated with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors compared to 7% for those who didn't receive such treatment. Among patients treated with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors, those with TP53 mutations (compared to wildtype TP53) exhibited a notably higher rate of improvement, suggesting a sensitivity to this treatment regimen."

Both cohorts received clinical benefit with an ORR of 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) and a median duration of response of 16.8 months (95% CI, 6.4 to not estimable [NE]) in the 5.4 mg/kg cohort and an ORR of 56% (95% CI, 41 to 70) and median duration of response of NE (95% CI, 8.3 to NE) in the 6.4 mg/kg cohort. Authors noted that deep and durable responses were seen regardless of HER2 mutation type, HER2 amplification status, baseline CNS metastasis, or prior treatment at both dose levels, but 5.4 mg/kg was associated with a more favorable safety profile."
11739,"In this phase 2a clinical trial, 26 patients with either BRCA1-deficient or BAP1-deficient mesotheliomas were treated with Rucaparib. 38% of the patients were BAP1 and BRCA1 negative, 89% were BAP1 negative, and 50% were BRCA1 negative. The disease control rate at 24 weeks was 23% (95% CI 9-44). Overall, the study reported positive clinical activity of Rucaparib in the patients with minimal adverse effects."

The median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI; 5.6 - 8.0), with the longest median PFS being 11.9 months (95% CI; 8.2 - 13.0) in patients with IHC3+. The median OS across all the cohorts was 13.4 months (95% CI; 11.9 - 15.5), with the longest median OS of 21.1 months (95% CI; 15.3 - 29.6) in the IHC3+ group. Overall, trastuzumab deruxtecan exhibited clinically meaningful PFS and OS in pretreated patients."
12014,"In this phase 3 trial, 308 patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR exon 20 insertions were treated with a combination of amivantamab and chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) [n = 153] or chemotherapy alone [n = 155]. The median PFS in the aminvantamab-chemotherapy group was 11.4 months which was significantly higher than the chemotherapy group (median PFS of 6.7 months). The hazard ratio reported for disease progression was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.30 - 0.53, p <0.001), while the hazard ratio reported for death for amivantamab-chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy was 0.67 (95% CI; 0.42 - 1.09, p =0.11). The median objective response in the amivantamab-chemotherapy group was 9.7 months (95% CI; 8.2-13.5) compared to 4.4 months (95% CI; 4.1-5.6) in the chemotherapy group. The majority of patients in the cohort reported at least one adverse event. Overall, the study reported significantly better clinical results in the patients treated with amivantamab-chemotherapy combination therapy compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone as a first-line treatment."
12015,"In this phase 3 clinical trial, 557 patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) were randomly assigned to two groups and treated with either osimertinib with chemotherapy or osimertinib monotherapy. Significantly higher PFS was noted in the group treated with osimertinib and chemotherapy compared to osimertinib monotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.62 (95% CI; 0.49 - 0.79, p < 0.0001). After 24 months, 57% (95% CI; 50-63) and 41% (95% CI; 35-47) of the patients in the osimertinib and chemotherapy versus osimertinib monotherapy groups respectively, were alive and progression-free. An objective response was reported in 83% of the patients in the osimertinib-chemotherapy group, while an objective response was observed in 76% of the patients in the osimertinib monotherapy group. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed more frequently in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy group."
12016,"In this ongoing phase 2 trial (FIREFLY-1), 76 patients, aged 6 months to 25 years, with pediatric low-grade glioma harbouring BRAF alterations (BRAF fusions or BRAF V600E mutations) were treated with tovorafenib (DAY-101). The overall response rate according to the RAPNO-LGG criteria was 51% (95% CI; 40-63) and the median PFS and DOR were 13.8 months (95% CI; 8.3-16.9) and 13.8 months (95% CI; 11.3 - NR) respectively. All patients experienced at least one adverse event which may be treatment-emergent, and 63% of the patients experienced Grade ≥3 adverse events."
12020,"In a phase 3 trial (NCT04305496) of 708 patients with advanced HR+ HER2- breast cancer, the combination of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib and the estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival compared to fulvestrant alone. Among the 289 patients (40.8%) with alterations (including PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN alterations), the median progression-free survival was 7.3 months in the capivasertib–fulvestrant group compared to 3.1 months in the placebo–fulvestrant group with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65). In the capivasertib–fulvestrant group, 110 patients had PIK3CA mutations, 18 had AKT mutations, 21 had PTEN alterations, 2 had PI3KCA and AKT1 double mutations, and 4 had both PIK3CA and PTEN alterations. A breakdown of response by individual mutation was not provided."
12028,"In this phase 2 clinical trial, the efficacy of RAF inhibitor tovorafenib (DAY-101) was investigated in patients between the ages of 6 months and 25 years, with pediatric low-grade gliomas harbouring BRAF alterations (fusions, rearrangements, or V600 mutations). The trial had two arms, arm 1 (n = 77) tested the efficacy of tovorafenib, while arm 2 (n=60) was an extension cohort, which provided treatment access for patients with RAF altered pLGG after arm 1 closure. The RANO-HGG criteria was used to assess efficacy in patients in arm 1. The overall response rate was 67% (95% CI; 54-78). Specifically, 12 (17%) patients had a complete response, 34 (49%) patients experienced a partial response, and 18 (26%) patients had stable disease as the best response. The ORR in patients with BRAF fusions and BRAF V600E mutations was 69% (95% CI; 56-81) and 50% (95% CI; 19-81) respectively. A relatively higher ORR was noted in patients who had received prior MAPK therapy compared to patients who hadn't received prior MAPK therapy. Specifically, the ORR was 71% (95%CI; 54-84) in patients who had received prior MAPK therapy, and 61% (95% CI; 41-78) in patients who hadn't received prior MAPK therapy.

12029,"In this phase 1/2 clinical trial, 55 patients (40 MDS, 11 AML, 4 MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms) with myelodysplastic syndromes harbouring TP53 mutations were treated with a combination of eprenetapopt and azacitidine. The ORR was 71% , with 44% achieving complete response. The study reported that patients harbouring only TP53 mutations, and no other somatic mutations by NGS, had higher rates of complete response (69% v 25%; p = 0.006). Overall, the combination therapy of eprenetapopt and azacitidine demonstrated clinically relevant benefits in patients with MDS and AML carrying TP53 mutations."
12034,"In this phase 3 double-blind trial, the efficacy of capivasertib and fulvestrant combination therapy was tested in 708 patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Among these 708 patients, 40.8% (n = 289) harboured AKT pathway alterations. The control group received a placebo plus fulvestrant. The median PFS in the population with AKT pathway alterations for the capivasertib-fulvestrant group was 7.3 months compared to 3.1 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR - 0.50; 95% CI [0.38-0.65], p<0.001). In the capivasertib–fulvestrant group, 110 patients had PIK3CA mutations, 18 had AKT mutations, 21 had PTEN alterations, 2 had PI3KCA and AKT1 double mutations, and 4 had both PIK3CA and PTEN alterations. A breakdown of response by individual mutation was not provided."
12035,"A 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4 underwent a craniotomy with gross total resection. A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy."
12056,"As part of this trial, 27 pediatric patients (aged 2-20), harbouring, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC, n = 14), RET fusion-positive papillary thyroid cancer (RTC, n=10), or other tumour types (n=3), were treated with selpercatinib. The ORR was 83.3% (10/12) in patients with RECIST measurable disease at baseline. The ORR of patients with PTC was 100% (5/5), and the ORR was 83.3% in patients with MTC (5/6). One patient with MTC had stable disease and no patients with MTC/PTC had PD."
12063,The efficacy of adagrasib + cetuximab combination therapy was tested in 94 patients harbouring colorectal cancers with KRAS G12C mutations. ORR was used as the primary end-point for the study. The ORR and disease control rate were 34.0% and 85.1% respectively. The median duration of response and progression free survival were 5.8 months (95% CI; 4.2-7.6). and 6.9 months (95% CI; 5.7-7.4) respectively. The overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI; 11.8-18.8).
12075,"In this study, 30 patients with advanced solid malignancies harboring mTOR/AKT/PI3K pathway alterations were treated with Sapanisertib. The tumor types included sarcomas, breast, ovarian, head and neck, colorectal, lung, renal, endometrial, gastroesophageal junction, prostate, stomach, urachus, and cervical cancer. Four patients achieved partial response, with three of them having PTEN mutations and one having AKT and mTOR mutations. Fifteen patients had stable disease as their best response. The median overall survival was 18 months (95% CI: 7.2 - NE), and the median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI: 2.8 - 14.6). Of the 24 evaluable patients, 19 (79%) had disease control (SD or PR)."
12083,"Exomes were sequenced from two cohorts of non small cell lung cancer patients who were treated with pembrolizumab. In a discovery cohort of 16 patients, durable clinical benefit (DCB - partial or stable response lasting >6 months) was measured. In patients with DCB, median number of nonsynonymous mutations was 302. Median number of mutations was 148 in patients with no DCB with pembrolizumab (p=0.02). Median number of mutations in the cohort was 209. 73% of patients with mutations above 209 showed DCB, while 13% of those with mutations below the median showed DCB (p=0.04). Median progression free survival was 14.5 versus 3.7 months between the two groups. In a validation group of 18 NSCLC samples, the median mutation burden was 244 in patients with DCB, and 125 in patients with no DCB. In patients with mutation burden above the median (200), there was 83% DCB with pembrolizumab, and 22% DCB in patients below the median mutation burden of 200. In all patients tested, C-to-A transversions were more frequent in patients with DCB, and C-to-T transitions were less frequent in DCB patients."
12099,"BRD4-NUT fusion was found to be associated with globally decreased histone acetylation and transcriptional repression in gain-of-expression and loss-of-expression assays. Following these results, it was postulated that chromatin acetylation would be restored by treatment of the cell lines with HDACi. In vivo efficacy of HDACi (LBH-589) was tested in 2 luciferized NMC cell line xenograft models (TC-797, PER-403) and significant suppression of tumour growth was noted in both models."
12120,"A 71-year-old male with esophageal carcinoma harboring NTRK1 amplification, based on FoundationOne CDx profiling test, was treated with larotrectinib. Treatment with larotrectinib led to a shrinkage of the primary tumor, in addition to liver and lung metastases within 6 weeks based on RECIST criteria. This was also accompanied by tumor marker decrease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma [SCC]). An increase in SCC and disease progression was observed in patient 3 months after starting on larotrectinib, which could likely be associated with a drop in NTRK1 levels below the limit of detection. These results indicate that larotrectinib may be efficacious in cases with NTRK1 gene amplification."
12131,"In this trial (MARIPOSA), 1074 patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer harbouring exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution were randomized (2:2:1) to receive lazertinib-amivantamab (n=429), osimertinib monotherapy (n=429) or lazertininib monotherapy (n=216). Patients who received lazertinib-amivantamab combination therapy had a significantly higher median PFS compared to patients who received osimertinib monotherapy (23.7 months vs. 16.6 months; HR 0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.85; p < 0.001]). Additionally, amivantamab-lazertinib prolonged PFS vs. osimertinib in patients with a history of brain metastases (18.3 months vs. 13.0 months; HR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.92]). In 136 patients with liver metastases at baseline, the median PFS was significantly prolonged in patients treated with amivantamab-lazertinib (18.2 months, 95% CI, 13.1-NE) compared to patients treated with osimertinib (11.0 months, 95% CI, 7.4-12.8), while the HR for disease progression in the amivantamab-lazertinib versus osimertinib groups was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.91, p = 0.017)."
12140,"Two phase I studies included 119 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, which included 28 patients with ROS1 rearrangements (n=28) where the overall safety and antitumor activity of entrectinib was examined. Entrectinib was shown to be safe and well tolerated. For phase 2, 14 ROS1-rearranged solid tumors were eligible. One of these patients had melanoma with GOPC-ROS1 found via next generation sequencing. This patient responded to entrectinib within a month of treatment, and was ongoing on the study after 11 months, with no disease progression."
12143,"The OncoBird framework utilizes data from the open-label, randomized phase III FIRE-3 trial, which involved patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who received either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI. In this trial, TOP1 amplifications were found to be strong predictors of prolonged overall survival in patients treated with cetuximab (p = 0.005, HR = 0.50 [0.30-0.81]). Additionally, favorable OS was also noted in CMS2 patients treated with cetuximab if their tumors carried chr20q amplifications like TOP1 amplifications (p = 0.01, HR = 0.34 [0.15-0.74])."
12156,"In this phase III trial, 657 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) harbouring EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or L858R) were treated with amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (chemotherapy). These patients were then randomized 2:2:1 to receive amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy (n=263), chemotherapy (n=263), or amivantamab-chemotherapy (n=131). PFS was significantly longer in the amivantamab-chemotherapy [median 6.3 months; HR 0.48, p <0.001] and the amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy [median 8.3 months; HR 0.44, p <0.001] groups compared to chemotherapy alone [median 4.2 months]. Additionally, ORR was also significantly higher in the amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy groups at, 64% (95% CI 55-72) and 63% (95% CI 57-69) respectively, compared to the chemotherapy group alone at 36% (p < 0.001 for both)."
12157,"In this phase III trial, 291 patients (12 years or older) with medullary thyroid cancer harbouring RET mutations were treated with selpercatinib. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive selpercatinib (n=193) or cabozantinib/vandetanib (control group, n=98). Progression-free survival in the selpercatinib group was 86.8% (95% CI, 79.8-91.6) and 65.7% (95% CI, 51.9-76.4) in the control group at 12 months. Additionally, median treatment failure-free survival was not reached in the selpercatinib group and was 13.9 months in the control group (HR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.15-0.42, p <0.001), as assessed by blinded independent central review. Treatment failure-free survival at 12 months was 86.2% (95% CI 79.1-91.0) in the treatment group, and 62.1% (95% CI, 48.9-72.8) in the control group. Finally, the ORR in the treatment and control group was 69.4% (95% CI, 48.9-72.8) and 38.8% (95% CI, 29.1-49.2) respectively. Overall, treatment with selpercatinib resulted in significantly better PFS compared to cabozantinib/vandetanib treatment in patients with progression, advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer."
12158,"In this phase 1 trial, 80 patients harbouring MTAP deletions/CDKN2A deletions received AMG 193 in a dose escalation study. The most common tumour types were PDAC (23.8%), NSCLC (17.5%), biliary tract cancer (BCT) (8.8%), GBM (6.3%) and gastric/esophageal cancer (2.5%). Of the 80 patients, 6 patients had MTAP-intact per central IHC and were therefore excluded from the efficacy analysis. The ORR was 21.4% (95% CI, 10.3-36.8), and the DCR was 54.8% (95% CI, 38.7-70.2). The median time to response (TTR) was 3.6 months (3.6-3.7) in the 800 mg QD cohort and 1.8 months in the 1200 mg QD cohort. The median DOR across all the cohorts was 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.7 - NE) with the longest being 12.9 months in a patient with RCC and 11.0 months in a patient with ovarian SLCT, and the median DoDC was 9.2 months (95% CI, 4.9-11.8). Finally, SDMA reduction (to near complete elimination) was noted in post-treatment biopsies from eight MTAP-deleted patients compared to pre-treatment biopsies at dose levels of 480 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg. Overall, encouraging anti-tumour activity of AMG 193 was noted in MTAP-deleted solid tumours between 800 mg and 1200 mg dose, with a manageable safety profile, and no dose-limiting cytopenia events reported."
12161,"In this trial, patients with advanced rare tumours harbouring BRAF V600E mutations were treated with a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. The study included eight distinct cohorts: anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) (n=36), biliary tract cancer (BTC)(n=43), gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) (n=1), adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (ASI) (n=3), low-grade glioma (LGG) (n=13), high-grade glioma (HGG)(n=45), hairy cell leukemia(HCL) (n=55), and multiple myeloma (MM)(n=19). The overall response rates for these cohorts were 56%, 53%, 0%, 67%, 54%, 33%, 89%, and 50% respectively. The median duration of response varied, with 14.4 months for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, 8.9 months for biliary tract cancer, 7.7 months for adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, 31.2 months for high-grade glioma, and 11.1 months in multiple myeloma. In the remaining cohorts, the duration of response was not reached. Progression-free survival was measured at 6.7 months for ATC, 9.0 months for BTC, 9.5 months for ASI, 5.5 months for HGG, and 6.3 months for MM. PFS could not be evaluated in the LGG and HCL groups due to small patient numbers. The overall survival was 14.5 months for ATC, 13.5 months for BTC, 17.6 months for HGG, 21.8 months for ASI, and 33.9 months for MM cohorts. OS could not be evaluated for the LGG and HCL groups due to a low number of deaths. Adverse events were reported in 97.6% of the patients (n=201), with 87.9% (n=181) of these being related to the study treatment. Serious adverse events occurred in 45.1% (n=93) of patients across all cohorts."

Patient initially received ALLTogether protocol Induction B but was MRD positive Day 29 and given consolidation. Day 71 he was MRD positive with multiple treatment-related side-effects at which point targeted RNA sequencing was performed (TruSight Pan-Cancer). A NUP214::ABL1 (e33::e3) fusion was identified, the result of a 445 kb duplication (too small for cutoffs in initial microarray studies and cryptic by FISH), and confirmed by RT-PCR. No ABL1 TKI-resistant mutations were identified so the patient was treated with imatinib mesylate with conventional chemotherapy. Patient was in complete remission in 1 month which was ongoing at 24 months from diagnosis."

Breakpoints were intron 24 for EGFR (NM_005228 chr7:55,268,165) and intron 3 of RAD51 (NM_002875 chr15:40,994,701) using hg19. Erlotinib 150 mg/qd was administered and decrease in tumor size was seen after one month via CT scan, and this was classified as partial response, with stable disease after 5 months treatment. The authors conclude that this case report supports erlotinib treatment of EGFR::RAD51 fusion NSCLC patients."
12369,"A 62 year-old female never smoker diagnosed of lung adenocarcinoma that was negative for EGFR and ALK alterations (EGFR hotspot tissue NGS) was treated with carboplatin/ pemetrexed/ bevacizumab (x 6 cycles) followed by maintenance (x4 cycles) prior to PD. She then went on nivolumab (x6 cycles) until Progressive Disease (PD) with pleural effusion and brain metastasis. An EGFR::RAD51 fusion was detected in the pleural fluid by Foundation Medicine. The DNA fusion consists of EGFR exons 1-24 (breakpoint in EGFR intron 24) coupled to RAD51 exons 4-10 (breakpoint in RAD51 intron 3). Patient was treated with afatinib (at 40 mg/d, then 30 mg/d) following detection of the EGFR::RAD51 fusion and showed stable disease after 6 months. The authors note that EGFR::RAD51 was not seen in earlier assays of the tumor, and state that this might be due to the appearance of the fusion during tumor evolution, or due to it being missed by earlier assays. They note that other detections of the fusion came from Foundation Medicine assays, and most other assays are not designed to cover EGFR exons 24 and 25."
12370,"This is a case report of 29-year-old diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the left lung. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles then maintenance with pembrolizumab and pemetrexed for 4 cycles before PD on lungs, brain and lymph nodes. FoundationOne DX1 on a new mediastinal lymph node biopsy detected an EGFR::RAD51 fusion. Patient was then treated with erlotinib (150mg/d) and achieved PR on all tumour sites three weeks following treatment initiation. The patient was switched to Osimertinib (80 mg/d) after being on erlotinib for two months due to renal toxicity. Further tumour response was observed at subsequent restating imaging and the patient is still on treatment 10 months since EGFR-TKI initiation."
12371,A 37-year-old never smoker was diagnosed of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with mucinous pattern. FoundationOne DX1 panel detected an EGFR::RAD51 fusion and the patient was treated with first-line gefitinib. The patient achieved CR three months after treatment initiation and developed PD after one year.
12372,"This is a case report of a 45-year-old male never smoker that was diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient responded poorly to the initial chemoimmunotherapy (carboplatin, pemetrexed, nivolumab, and ipilimumab) and progressively deteriorated. Following the detection of an EGFR::RAD51 gene fusion by repeat NGS using FoundationOne Liquid CDx, the patient was treated with Osimertinib (80mg/d) and experienced dramatic symptom improvement within one month of treatment initiation. Despite asymptomatic intracranial metastases with stable systemic disease at 9 months, the patient remained on therapy and continued to show PR 12 months after initiation of Osimertinib."
12406,"A 31 year old male initially thought to have a mandibular osteosarcoma that was resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and cisplatin-doxorubicin. He had a mandibular recurrence with multiple pulmonary nodules 12 months after diagnosis, at which point he underwent whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing of their lesion. In both RNA and DNA, an in-frame deletion of exons 2-18 of ALK which retains the kinase domain and leads to activation as well as a FUS::TFCP2 fusion resulting from a rearrangements between FUS intron 6 (exons 1-6) and TFCP2 intron 1 (exons 2-15) were identified. His cancer progressed following ifosfamide-etoposide chemotherapy and then after radiation with regorafenib, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Compassionate use of alectinib was then given, resulting in dramatic clinical improvement within 48 hours, allowing him to stop ventilation. By 2 weeks there was radiological evidence of response. After 3 weeks there was new evidence of subcutaneous metastasis and pericardial involvement. The patient died of his disease 4 weeks after starting alectinib. The authors posit that this is still evidence of response but this was short lived due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and it's advanced stage at the time of treatment."
12469,"Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is frequently observed in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy. FGFR inhibitors have shown potential to overcome this resistance. A phase II study, the NCI-MATCH ECOG-ACRIN Trial (EAY131) Subprotocol K1 (NCT06308822), was an open-label, single-arm trial that required central confirmation of FGFR1–4 amplification in tumors. A total of 18 patients were enrolled, including 9 with breast cancer. FGFR amplifications were detected by the NCI-MATCH sequencing assay, with a minimum laboratory reported copy number of 7.0. All participants received oral erdafitinib at a starting dose of 8 mg once daily, with dose escalation to 9 mg permitted based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was the centrally assessed objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6), overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. No confirmed responses to erdafitinib were observed. However, five patients achieved stable disease as their best response. Notably, one patient with FGFR1-amplified breast cancer experienced prolonged survival, with a PFS exceeding 168 days (5.5 months)."
12478,"Dovitinib, a pan-FGFR small molecular inhibitor, has shown activity in pre-clinical models against FGFR-expressing breast cancer model cell lines, as well as as in a single agent in a phase II clinical trial in HR+/HER2- FGFR1 amplified breast cancer patients. Notably, this is among patients with higher levels of FGFR amplification. A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2− locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression. FGF pathway amplification was determined using TaqMan assay as described by (André F. et al, 2013). Positive amplification for each FGF pathway marker tested (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3) was defined as a copy number ≥6. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). However, the study had to be stopped early due to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The overall response rate (assessed at regular radiological assessment) in the dovitinib + fulvestrant arm (n=47) was 27.7%, as compared to 10% in the placebo + fulvestrant arm (n=50), irrespective of the presence of FGF pathway amplification. The FGFR-amplified subgroup (n=31) reached a median PFS of 10.9 months vs 5.5 months in the dovitinib + fulvestrant vs placebo + fulvestrant arms respectively. The final analysis showed limited benefit, with the authors' recommendation to exercise caution when interpreting the study results (particularly the PFS results), due to a fewer than expected number of PFS events (18 vs 50 planned events), as well as the study's small sample size."
