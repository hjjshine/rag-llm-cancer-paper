"In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1187
"A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci. Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation. BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC, and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1188

This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment.

"Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing. 5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.

"In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20. 3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice. The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate. While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity. Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1196

The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells.

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells.

Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122.

FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1710

Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment.

Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6376
"This phase II clinical trial of regorafenib (NCT01068769) examined the long term safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who failed previous treatments with imatinib. Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations. 15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2).",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6377

Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days.

"This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib.

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001).

"Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control.

FISH using a BCR-ABL1 probe demonstrated 50-80 extrachromosomal copies of ABL1; FISH using probes to the 3' regions of ABL1 and NUP214 confirmed NUP214-ABL1 amplification in ~99% of cells. The NUP214-ABL1 amplification was also confirmed by MLPA and SNP6.0 analysis. Additionally, this patient harbored a focal deletion of IKZF1 (exons 2-7) and CDKN2A/B (exons 1-2). Day 29 marrow showed complete morphological remission; however PCR-based IgVH MRD rearrangement studies revealed clonal IgVH rearrangement (1 in 10^4 cells). Patient underwent sibling donor allogenic stem cell transplant, and at 4 months is in complete remission. NUP214-ABL1 positive patient primary cells were cultured with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib). After 72-hour culture there was no significant reduction in viable cell numbers or increase in apoptosis, when compared to the no drug control.

"Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with break-apart probes, the authors screened retrospectively 55 pediatric and 50 adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases negative for common drivers (B-other) for rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2 and PDGFRB tyrosine kinase genes. Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9159

The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy.

Therefore, the patient was treated with combination chemotherapy comprising 800 mg of imatinib for 7 days and 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days followed by 140 mg of dasatinib daily. On day 74, lymphoblasts disappeared from the peripheral blood, but 15% remained in the bone marrow. A second course of hyper-CVAD with 140 mg of dasatinib daily was administered. Twenty days after therapy using 1.5 g of methotrexate and cytarabine (total dose; 18 g), lymphoblasts suddenly increased by 82%. Administration of 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days was highly effective in reducing lymphoblast count.

The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully.

Functional investigation of this mutation including PC12 cell neurite outgrowth, NIH3T3 transformation and phosophoproteomics showing increased ALK signaling all suggested that it was a gain function. The patient was treated with Ceritinib as a monotherapy for 7.5 months. The residual primary decreased in size (44% volume reduction at 6 months of treatment) and was surgically removed.

"An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10361

For diagnosis, the patients must have an 8p11 translocation resulting in FGFR1 rearrangement. The starting dose of pemigatinib was 13.5 mg daily (2 weeks on; 1 week off). With amendments, patients without prior therapy were eligible for a starting dose of 13.5 mg daily on a continuous schedule. The endpoints examined in this analysis include rates of complete response (CR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Among 40 patients with FGFR1-mutant MLN, the most common FGFR1 fusion partner gene was ZMYM2 (13q12) (n = 17). For previously treated patients, among the 33 patients with BM and/or EMD involvement, the CR rate was 75.8%. Among the 35 patients evaluable for cytogenetic response, the CCyR rate was 71.4%. For the 5 treatment-naive patients, 2 of 2 patients with CP disease achieved CR and CCyR, and 1 of 3 pts with BP disease achieved CR and CCyR.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11324

"The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancers. This was achieved by reviewing data from two global, multicenter clinical trials of patients treated with larotrectinib: a phase II adult and young adult basket trial (NCT02576431) and a phase I adult trial (NCT02122913). The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively. Of the total of 20 NTRK-fusions positive lung cancer cases, 6 had TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, but detailed response information was only provided for one TPM3::NTRK1 positive case. This patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer which previously progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy after 9 months and on the PD-1 inhibitor dostarlimab after 2 months. A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control. The authors concluded that larotrectinib was highly active with rapid and durable responses, extended survival benefit, and a favorable long-term safety profile in patients with advanced lung cancer harboring NTRK gene fusions, including the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11692

"A female patient, 43 presented with right lower quadrant pain, and was surgically treated for perforated appendicitis including segmental small-bowel resection. Invasive adenocarcinoma stage IIB (pT4aN0) of the cecum was identified in the pathology, with intact MMR. The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy. A year later the patient showed recurrence of the tumor mass consistent with stage IV recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer. Testing revealed the tumor to be MSI-High. TPR-NTRK1 was found in the tumor by NGS and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was found (39 mutations/Mb). Pembrolizumab was given (four cycles), but patient progressed. Combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab and nivolumab was then given, followed by further progression. Patient was then given NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib and after 5 weeks a considerable decrease in the size of peritoneal metastasis was seen, accompanied by other tumor shrinkage and remarkable improvement of symptoms.

"A 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4 underwent a craniotomy with gross total resection. A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement.

"In this phase III trial (PALOMA-3), patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Patients were randomized to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant (P+F) or placebo plus fulvestrant (F). A paired ctDNA exome sequencing was conducted to analyze clonal composition. RB1 mutations were identified in 6/127 patients (p=0.041), part of the P + F arm, while no RB1 mutations were identified in the patients treated with fulvestrant alone, at EOT (end of treatment). ESR1 mutations were noted in 25.1% at day 1, and 31.3% of the patients at EOT. An increased proportion of PIK3CA mutations were noted at EOT compared to day 1 (19% v/s 26.7%; p = 0.00069). Additionally, the proportions of patients with new PIK3CA mutations did not differ between the two treatment groups, which suggests that these mutations may play a role in fulvestrant resistance. Strong evidence was reported for positive selection for ESR1 Y537S through the treatment in both treatment groups (p=0.0037), suggesting this mutation may promote resistance to fulvestrant. The data also indicates that resistance to fulvestrant may be a major genetic driver of resistance to the combination treatment.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12045

Further tumour response was observed at subsequent restating imaging and the patient is still on treatment 10 months since EGFR-TKI initiation.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12370
A 37-year-old never smoker was diagnosed of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with mucinous pattern. FoundationOne DX1 panel detected an EGFR::RAD51 fusion and the patient was treated with first-line gefitinib. The patient achieved CR three months after treatment initiation and developed PD after one year.,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12371
"This is a case report of a 45-year-old male never smoker that was diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient responded poorly to the initial chemoimmunotherapy (carboplatin, pemetrexed, nivolumab, and ipilimumab) and progressively deteriorated. Following the detection of an EGFR::RAD51 gene fusion by repeat NGS using FoundationOne Liquid CDx, the patient was treated with Osimertinib (80mg/d) and experienced dramatic symptom improvement within one month of treatment initiation. Despite asymptomatic intracranial metastases with stable systemic disease at 9 months, the patient remained on therapy and continued to show PR 12 months after initiation of Osimertinib.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12372
"In this study, the authors characterized the TEL (currently ETV6)::AML1 (currently RUNX1) gene fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(12;21)(p12;q22) using cytogenetic and molecular methods, including FISH, PCR, Southern blot hybridization, and sequencing. Analysis of nine patient specimens (two AML, seven B-ALL) and two cell lines revealed that the TEL (ETV6) gene breakpoint in t(12;21)(p12;q22) differs from the one in t(5;12)(q33;p13) seen in Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). The TEL (ETV6) gene remained active on both derivative chromosomes, with der(21) expressing a 5’ ETV6::3'RUNX1 fusion transcript lacking the ETS DNA-binding domain, while der(12) expressed the ETS domain under an unknown promoter (G4). Additionally, ETV6 was deleted from the normal chromosome 12. The breakpoint in the RUNX1 gene was at its 5’ end, upstream of breakpoints in other myeloid malignancies [t(8;21), t(3;21)]. The ETV6::RUNX1 fusion protein retained helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain from the ETV6-encoded protein which interacts with transcriptional regulators, and nearly entire RUNX1-encoded protein. The chimeric protein was predicted to cause dysregulated transcription of lymphoid lineage-specific genes. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of ETV6::RUNX1-driven leukemogenesis in B-ALL.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12374
"A 31 year old male initially thought to have a mandibular osteosarcoma that was resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and cisplatin-doxorubicin. He had a mandibular recurrence with multiple pulmonary nodules 12 months after diagnosis, at which point he underwent whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing of their lesion. In both RNA and DNA, an in-frame deletion of exons 2-18 of ALK which retains the kinase domain and leads to activation as well as a FUS::TFCP2 fusion resulting from a rearrangements between FUS intron 6 (exons 1-6) and TFCP2 intron 1 (exons 2-15) were identified. His cancer progressed following ifosfamide-etoposide chemotherapy and then after radiation with regorafenib, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Compassionate use of alectinib was then given, resulting in dramatic clinical improvement within 48 hours, allowing him to stop ventilation. By 2 weeks there was radiological evidence of response. After 3 weeks there was new evidence of subcutaneous metastasis and pericardial involvement. The patient died of his disease 4 weeks after starting alectinib. The authors posit that this is still evidence of response but this was short lived due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and it's advanced stage at the time of treatment.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12406
"A cross-sectional cohort study was performed in 161 men with metastatic prostate cancer undergoing a change in treatment to determine if pre-therapy AR-V7 nuclear protein expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a treatment-specific marker for outcomes between androgen receptor signaling (ARS) inhibitors and taxanes. A multivariable model adjusting for baseline factor associated with survival showed superior overall survival with taxanes relative to ARS inhibitors when AR-V7-positive CTCs were detected pre-therapy (hazard ratio , 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.57; P=0.035).",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12463
"A blinded, multi-institutional cohort study was performed in 142 men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer to determine if pre-therapy nuclear-localized expression of AR-V7 protein in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a treatment-selective marker for outcome following treatment with either androgen receptor signaling (ARS) inhibitors or taxanes. Patients with AR-V7-positive CTCs had superior overall survival with taxanes vs ARS inhibitors (hazard ratio 0.62; 95% CI 0.28-1.39; P=.25). Patients with AR-V7-negative CTCs had superior overall survival with ARS inhibitors vs taxanes (hazard ratio 1.67; 95 CI 1.00-2.81); P=.05).",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12464
"Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is frequently observed in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy. FGFR inhibitors have shown potential to overcome this resistance. A phase II study, the NCI-MATCH ECOG-ACRIN Trial (EAY131) Subprotocol K1 (NCT06308822), was an open-label, single-arm trial that required central confirmation of FGFR1–4 amplification in tumors. A total of 18 patients were enrolled, including 9 with breast cancer. FGFR amplifications were detected by the NCI-MATCH sequencing assay, with a minimum laboratory reported copy number of 7.0. All participants received oral erdafitinib at a starting dose of 8 mg once daily, with dose escalation to 9 mg permitted based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was the centrally assessed objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6), overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. No confirmed responses to erdafitinib were observed. However, five patients achieved stable disease as their best response. Notably, one patient with FGFR1-amplified breast cancer experienced prolonged survival, with a PFS exceeding 168 days (5.5 months).",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12469
"Dovitinib, a pan-FGFR small molecular inhibitor, has shown activity in pre-clinical models against FGFR-expressing breast cancer model cell lines, as well as as in a single agent in a phase II clinical trial in HR+/HER2- FGFR1 amplified breast cancer patients. Notably, this is among patients with higher levels of FGFR amplification. A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2− locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression. FGF pathway amplification was determined using TaqMan assay as described by (André F. et al, 2013). Positive amplification for each FGF pathway marker tested (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3) was defined as a copy number ≥6. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). However, the study had to be stopped early due to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The overall response rate (assessed at regular radiological assessment) in the dovitinib + fulvestrant arm (n=47) was 27.7%, as compared to 10% in the placebo + fulvestrant arm (n=50), irrespective of the presence of FGF pathway amplification. The FGFR-amplified subgroup (n=31) reached a median PFS of 10.9 months vs 5.5 months in the dovitinib + fulvestrant vs placebo + fulvestrant arms respectively. The final analysis showed limited benefit, with the authors' recommendation to exercise caution when interpreting the study results (particularly the PFS results), due to a fewer than expected number of PFS events (18 vs 50 planned events), as well as the study's small sample size.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12478
"The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilizing Registry (TAPUR) study is a prospective, phase II, basket trial that aims to evaluate the antitumor activity of commercially available targeted therapies prescribed to patients with advanced cancer with actionable targets. In this study, sunitinib is evaluated in patients with breast cancer, with FGFR alterations. Patients eligible for the study include those age 12 years or older, who have BC with an FGFR1/2 amplification or mutation. Definitions of amplification were not prespecified in the protocol because of the variety of genomic tests that could qualify a patient for participating in the study. The primary endpoint was disease control (DC) based on the investigator assessment – this was defined as objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) of at least 16 weeks duration (SD16+), measured from the initiation of study treatment, as determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, duration of SD, and safety. Thirty patients with BC with FGFR1 alterations (amplification = 26, mutation = 1, both amp + mut = 3) were initially enrolled. Due to patient ineligibility and drop out, 27 patients were evaluable for sunitinib efficacy (amp=26, mut=1). With regards to DC, two patients were reported with partial response and four with SD16+ were observed for DC. The DC rate was calculated to be 27% (90% CI, 13 to 100) and OR to be 7% (95% CI, 1 to 24). The median PFS was 9 weeks in the FGFR1 cohort (95% CI, 8 to 16). Given the null hypothesis of a 15% DC rate was not rejected, sunitinib did not meet the study’s thresholds for demonstrating antitumor activity in patients with BC harboring FGFR1 amplifications. The study concludes that sunitinib is not recommended for off-label use in FGFR1-altered BC.",https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12479
