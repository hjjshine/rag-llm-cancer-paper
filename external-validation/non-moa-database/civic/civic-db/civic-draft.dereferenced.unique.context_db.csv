Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation. Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months. While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.

Description: Four myeloma cell lines were treated with two different BET inhibitors (I-BET151 or JQ1). Proliferation of three cell lines (KMS11, RPMI8226 and MM1S) but not U266 (only partial inhibition) was strongly inhibited by the BET inhibitors. Microarray analysis showed a downregulation of MYC-dependent genes after treatment. qRT-PCR showed that MYCL1 but not c-MYC and MYCN was expressed in U266 cells and I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1. In contrast, c-MYC but not MYCL was expressed in the other cell lines and I-BET151 induced downregulation of c-MYC.

Description: In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.

These alterations included recurrent NRG1 rearrangements predicted to drive PDAC development through aberrant ERBB receptor-mediated signaling, and pharmacologic ERBB inhibition resulted in clinical improvement and remission of liver metastases in two patients with NRG1-rearranged tumors that had proved resistant to standard treatment. One patient (30) was treated with afatinib monotherapy and showed improvement at 7 weeks, followed by progression at 3 months after necessary dose reduction.

Functional investigation of this mutation including PC12 cell neurite outgrowth, NIH3T3 transformation and phosophoproteomics showing increased ALK signaling all suggested that it was a gain function. The patient was treated with Ceritinib as a monotherapy for 7.5 months. The residual primary decreased in size (44% volume reduction at 6 months of treatment) and was surgically removed. At 21 months of followup a complete remission was observed (including all metastatic sites).

Treatment with either etoposide or olaparib significantly reduced the volume of the SF3B1-K700E mutant tumours, but had little effect on the volume of SF3B1-WT tumours.

Description: Of 351 primary thyroid carcinoma patients assessed by targeted gene rearrangement next-generation assay, 11 cases (3.1%) had NTRK rearrangement. Only one case of EML4::NTRK3 fusion (e2,e13) with an intact kinase domain was detected in an intracranial metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment at initial diagnosis. However, disease persisted and after three decades brain metastasis occurred. NTRK inhibitor therapy was given which showed a 69.7% decrease in disease burden following 34 cycles of entrectinib (400 mg daily) with mild side effects. pTERT C228T mutation and the frameshift MEN1 deletion cooccurred with EML4::NTRK3 fusion and both did not confer to entrectinib resistance.

A total of 3 patients had CHEK1 mutations, 2 in olaparib arm and 1 in control arm. Based on the results of this study, on May 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib (LYNPARZA) for adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated mCRPC, who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone.

Median progression-free survival was 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.12 – 13.80, however, median progression-free survival was shorter for patients with the uncommon mutations. The median overall survival was 24.8 months (95% CI: 21.98 – 38.74), and the median overall survival for patients with the less common mutations was again shorter. Grade 3 adverse events were more common in patients receiving the higher 50 mg starting dose, and there was one possible drug-related death secondary to interstitial lung disease.

Description: This phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to assess the progression-free survival in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas treated with Vorasidenib, an oral brain-penetrant inhibitor, which showed preliminary activity in mutant gliomas. In this double-blind study, participants having residual or recurrent IDH-mutated grade 2 gliomas were randomly selected to either receive vorasidenib or placebo in 28-day cycles. Patients with specific IDH2 mutations (R172K, R172W, and R172G) were randomly assigned to either a vorasidenib or placebo group (R172K: 3 vs. 10, R172W: 0 vs. 1, R172G: 2 vs. 0). The results showed significant improvement in progression-free survival for patients treated with vorasidenib compared to placebo (median progression-free survival, 27.7 months vs. 11.1 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.56; P<0.001). Vorasidenib treatment also delayed the time to the next intervention.

Description: A 71-year-old male with esophageal carcinoma harboring NTRK1 amplification, based on FoundationOne CDx profiling test, was treated with larotrectinib. Treatment with larotrectinib led to a shrinkage of the primary tumor, in addition to liver and lung metastases within 6 weeks based on RECIST criteria. This was also accompanied by tumor marker decrease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma [SCC]). An increase in SCC and disease progression was observed in patient 3 months after starting on larotrectinib, which could likely be associated with a drop in NTRK1 levels below the limit of detection. These results indicate that larotrectinib may be efficacious in cases with NTRK1 gene amplification.

The estimated 24-month duration of response (DOR) was 100%. The median PFS was 16.4 months (95% CI, 3.2 to NR). In patients treated with a combination of trametinib and dabrafenib 25% (95% CI, 12.1-42.2; n=9) had objective PRs and 64% (n=23) experienced stable disease. The median DOR was 33.6 months (95% CI, 11.2 - NR), while the 24-month DOR was 80% (95% CI, 30-100). The median PFS was 36.9 months (95% CI, 36.0 - NR).

The authors posit that this is still evidence of response but this was short lived due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and it's advanced stage at the time of treatment.

FGFR inhibitors have shown potential to overcome this resistance. A phase II study, the NCI-MATCH ECOG-ACRIN Trial (EAY131) Subprotocol K1 (NCT06308822), was an open-label, single-arm trial that required central confirmation of FGFR1–4 amplification in tumors. A total of 18 patients were enrolled, including 9 with breast cancer. FGFR amplifications were detected by the NCI-MATCH sequencing assay, with a minimum laboratory reported copy number of 7.0. All participants received oral erdafitinib at a starting dose of 8 mg once daily, with dose escalation to 9 mg permitted based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was the centrally assessed objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6), overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. No confirmed responses to erdafitinib were observed.

12478,B,2025-08-13 19:15:51 UTC,CIVIC,Breast Cancer,"Dovitinib, a pan-FGFR small molecular inhibitor, has shown activity in pre-clinical models against FGFR-expressing breast cancer model cell lines, as well as as in a single agent in a phase II clinical trial in HR+/HER2- FGFR1 amplified breast cancer patients. Notably, this is among patients with higher levels of FGFR amplification. A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2− locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression. FGF pathway amplification was determined using TaqMan assay as described by (André F. et al, 2013). Positive amplification for each FGF pathway marker tested (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3) was defined as a copy number ≥6. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). However, the study had to be stopped early due to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The overall response rate (assessed at regular radiological assessment) in the dovitinib + fulvestrant arm (n=47) was 27.7%, as compared to 10% in the placebo + fulvestrant arm (n=50), irrespective of the presence of FGF pathway amplification. The FGFR-amplified subgroup (n=31) reached a median PFS of 10.9 months vs 5.5 months in the dovitinib + fulvestrant vs placebo + fulvestrant arms respectively. The final analysis showed limited benefit, with the authors' recommendation to exercise caution when interpreting the study results (particularly the PFS results), due to a fewer than expected number of PFS events (18 vs 50 planned events), as well as the study's small sample size.",['Dovitinib'],Breast Cancer,['FGFR1 Amplification'],"Approval level: B
