Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20. 3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice. The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.

Mice treated with 100mg/kg experienced a 76% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced a 90% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced with pictilisib administration. Three other HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines harbored PIK3CA H1047R: UACC-893, HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, which had IC50s of 0.41uM, 0.49uM, and 0.64uM, suggesting that PIK3CA H1047R induces sensitivity to pictilisib in HER2 amplified breast cancer. Authors note that pictilisib was well tolerated in vivo and further note that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like cell lines (p=0.002).\nCancer type: Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer\nBiomarkers: PIK3CA H1047RTherapy: PictilisibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2096\nUpdated date: 2023-01-09 21:46:28 UTC", "Approval level: D\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: This preclinical study tested the efficacy of GDC-0941, a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K, on several cell lines of breast cancer.

Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients).

Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully. Since then, there is an ongoing remission that, to date, has lasted 30 months.\nCancer type: B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma\nBiomarkers: RCSD1::ABL1 FusionTherapy: DasatinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9168\nUpdated date: 2023-01-09 21:47:01 UTC", "Approval level: C\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: Authors reported a 15-year-old female diagnosed with B-ALL with the t(1;9)(q24;q34.1).

After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D).

One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3).

Patients were screened for presence of EZH2 mutations and only one patient had an activating mutation in EZH2. The patients were treated with Tazemetostat at a dose of 800 mg twice a day. Three of the four patients had partial response (including the one with the activating mutation), while one had a stable disease status after the treatment cycle.

This was achieved by reviewing data from two global, multicenter clinical trials of patients treated with larotrectinib: a phase II adult and young adult basket trial (NCT02576431) and a phase I adult trial (NCT02122913). The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion\u2013positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively. Of the total of 20 NTRK-fusions positive lung cancer cases, 6 had TPM3::NTRK1 fusion, but detailed response information was only provided for one TPM3::NTRK1 positive case. This patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV non\u2013small-cell lung cancer which previously progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy after 9 months and on the PD-1 inhibitor dostarlimab after 2 months. A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control. The authors concluded that larotrectinib was highly active with rapid and durable responses, extended survival benefit, and a favorable long-term safety profile in patients with advanced lung cancer harboring NTRK gene fusions, including the TPM3::NTRK1 fusion.\nCancer type: Lung Carcinoma\nBiomarkers: TPM3::NTRK1 FusionTherapy: LarotrectinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11692\nUpdated date: 2024-05-13 16:33:50 UTC", "Approval level: A\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: This was a Phase 1/2 study in which 55 patients between 4 months and 76 years of age with TRK-fusion positive tumors were given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib.

A year later the patient showed recurrence of the tumor mass consistent with stage IV recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer. Testing revealed the tumor to be MSI-High. TPR-NTRK1 was found in the tumor by NGS and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was found (39 mutations/Mb). Pembrolizumab was given (four cycles), but patient progressed. Combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab and nivolumab was then given, followed by further progression. Patient was then given NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib and after 5 weeks a considerable decrease in the size of peritoneal metastasis was seen, accompanied by other tumor shrinkage and remarkable improvement of symptoms. Curative-intent surgical resection of the tumor mass was performed, and adjuvant larotrectinib was declined.

Erlotinib 150 mg/qd was administered and decrease in tumor size was seen after one month via CT scan, and this was classified as partial response, with stable disease after 5 months treatment. The authors conclude that this case report supports erlotinib treatment of EGFR::RAD51 fusion NSCLC patients.\nCancer type: Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma\nBiomarkers: EGFR::RAD51 e24::e4Therapy: ErlotinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12360\nUpdated date: 2025-04-07 23:08:09 UTC", "Approval level: C\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: A 62 year-old female never smoker diagnosed of lung adenocarcinoma that was negative for EGFR and ALK alterations (EGFR hotspot tissue NGS) was treated with carboplatin/ pemetrexed/ bevacizumab (x 6 cycles) followed by maintenance (x4 cycles) prior to PD. She then went on nivolumab (x6 cycles) until Progressive Disease (PD) with pleural effusion and brain metastasis. An EGFR::RAD51 fusion was detected in the pleural fluid by Foundation Medicine. The DNA fusion consists of EGFR exons 1-24 (breakpoint in EGFR intron 24) coupled to RAD51 exons 4-10 (breakpoint in RAD51 intron 3). Patient was treated with afatinib (at 40 mg/d, then 30 mg/d) following detection of the EGFR::RAD51 fusion and showed stable disease after 6 months. The authors note that EGFR::RAD51 was not seen in earlier assays of the tumor, and state that this might be due to the appearance of the fusion during tumor evolution, or due to it being missed by earlier assays. They note that other detections of the fusion came from Foundation Medicine assays, and most other assays are not designed to cover EGFR exons 24 and 25.\nCancer type: Lung Adenocarcinoma\nBiomarkers: EGFR::RAD51 e24::e4Therapy: AfatinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12369\nUpdated date: 2025-06-10 20:45:05 UTC", "Approval level: C\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: This is a case report of 29-year-old diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the left lung.

He had a mandibular recurrence with multiple pulmonary nodules 12 months after diagnosis, at which point he underwent whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing of their lesion. In both RNA and DNA, an in-frame deletion of exons 2-18 of ALK which retains the kinase domain and leads to activation as well as a FUS::TFCP2 fusion resulting from a rearrangements between FUS intron 6 (exons 1-6) and TFCP2 intron 1 (exons 2-15) were identified. His cancer progressed following ifosfamide-etoposide chemotherapy and then after radiation with regorafenib, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Compassionate use of alectinib was then given, resulting in dramatic clinical improvement within 48 hours, allowing him to stop ventilation. By 2 weeks there was radiological evidence of response. After 3 weeks there was new evidence of subcutaneous metastasis and pericardial involvement. The patient died of his disease 4 weeks after starting alectinib. The authors posit that this is still evidence of response but this was short lived due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and it's advanced stage at the time of treatment.\nCancer type: Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma\nBiomarkers: FUS::TFCP2 Fusion, ALK Exon 2-18 DeletionTherapy: AlectinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12406\nUpdated date: 2025-05-20 21:42:45 UTC", "Approval level: B\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is frequently observed in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy. FGFR inhibitors have shown potential to overcome this resistance. A phase II study, the NCI-MATCH ECOG-ACRIN Trial (EAY131) Subprotocol K1 (NCT06308822), was an open-label, single-arm trial that required central confirmation of FGFR1\u20134 amplification in tumors. A total of 18 patients were enrolled, including 9 with breast cancer. FGFR amplifications were detected by the NCI-MATCH sequencing assay, with a minimum laboratory reported copy number of 7.0. All participants received oral erdafitinib at a starting dose of 8 mg once daily, with dose escalation to 9 mg permitted based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was the centrally assessed objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6), overall PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. No confirmed responses to erdafitinib were observed. However, five patients achieved stable disease as their best response. Notably, one patient with FGFR1-amplified breast cancer experienced prolonged survival, with a PFS exceeding 168 days (5.5 months).\nCancer type: Breast Cancer\nBiomarkers: FGFR1 AmplificationTherapy: ErdafitinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12469\nUpdated date: 2025-08-04 13:04:11 UTC", "Approval level: B\nDatabase: CIVIC\nDescription: Dovitinib, a pan-FGFR small molecular inhibitor, has shown activity in pre-clinical models against FGFR-expressing breast cancer model cell lines, as well as as in a single agent in a phase II clinical trial in HR+/HER2- FGFR1 amplified breast cancer patients. Notably, this is among patients with higher levels of FGFR amplification. A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2\u2212 locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression. FGF pathway amplification was determined using TaqMan assay as described by (Andr\u00e9 F. et al, 2013). Positive amplification for each FGF pathway marker tested (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3) was defined as a copy number \u22656. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). However, the study had to be stopped early due to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The overall response rate (assessed at regular radiological assessment) in the dovitinib + fulvestrant arm (n=47) was 27.7%, as compared to 10% in the placebo + fulvestrant arm (n=50), irrespective of the presence of FGF pathway amplification. The FGFR-amplified subgroup (n=31) reached a median PFS of 10.9 months vs 5.5 months in the dovitinib + fulvestrant vs placebo + fulvestrant arms respectively. The final analysis showed limited benefit, with the authors' recommendation to exercise caution when interpreting the study results (particularly the PFS results), due to a fewer than expected number of PFS events (18 vs 50 planned events), as well as the study's small sample size.\nCancer type: Breast Cancer\nBiomarkers: FGFR1 AmplificationTherapy: DovitinibApproval url: https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12478\nUpdated date: 2025-08-13 19:15:51 UTC"]
