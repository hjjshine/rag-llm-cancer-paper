Multiple patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET amplification in conjunction with EGFR mutation progressed on erlotinib or gefitinib (PMID: 18093943, 17463250). In two studies of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer that progressed on gefitinib, the presence of MET amplification was acquired in post-progression specimens in four and three samples, respectively (PMID: 17463250, 18093943). The effect of MET on drug sensitivity was confirmed in vitro in EGFR-mutated cell lines, and further analysis indicated that MET drives resistance through ERBB3-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway (PMID: 17463250, 18093943). Larger studies have demonstrated that MET amplification affects response to EGFR TKIs, including osimertinib (PMID: 30676858, 30073261)(Abstract: Michels et al.
