The NCCN recommendation is based on data in patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (irrespective of POLE/D1 mutation status), which includes results from the Phase II J1365 (NCT01876511) trial of pembrolizumab in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without dMMR. In this trial the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer or MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal solid tumors was 40% (95% CI=12–74) and 71% (95% CI=29–96), respectively, while the ORR to pembrolizumab in patients with MMR-proficient colorectal cancer was 0% (PMID: 26028255). While median OS was not reached in patients with dMMR tumors, median PFS in patients with MMR-proficient tumors was 2.2 months (95% CI=1.4–2.8) and median OS was 5.0 months (95% CI=3.0–not estimable) (PMID: 26028255). Additionally, in the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067) study of pembrolizumab in 233 patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced non-CRC, among nineteen patients with SBA, the ORR was 42.1% (95% CI=20.3–66.5) with three complete responses (15.8%) and five partial responses (26.3%) (PMID: 31682550).",POLE,p286r,"{'id': 903, 'code': '', 'color': 'SaddleBrown', 'name': '', 'mainType': {'id': None, 'name': 'Small Bowel Cancer', 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}, 'tissue': 'Bowel', 'children': {}, 'parent': None, 'level': 0, 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}"

In a retrospective, multinational study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, patients with POLE/D1 pd tumors (n=27) had significantly improved outcomes compared to patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (n=610), with overall response rates (ORRs) of 89% versus 54%, progression-free survival (PFS) rates at two years of 88% versus 60%, and overall survival (OS) rates at two years of 86% versus 72%, respectively (PMID: 38777726). In a pan-cancer study of patients with MSI-stable/low tumors treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PDL-1 inhibitors, patients with functional POLE/D1 mutations (n=24) had a clinical benefit rate of 75% versus 30% for patients with POLE/D1 wildtype tumors (n=1038) (PMID: 35817971). The NCCN recommendation is based on data in patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (irrespective of POLE/D1 mutation status), which includes results from the Phase II J1365 (NCT01876511) trial of pembrolizumab in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without dMMR. In this trial the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer or MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal solid tumors was 40% (95% CI=12–74) and 71% (95% CI=29–96), respectively, while the ORR to pembrolizumab in patients with MMR-proficient colorectal cancer was 0% (PMID: 26028255). While median OS was not reached in patients with dMMR tumors, median PFS in patients with MMR-proficient tumors was 2.2 months (95% CI=1.4–2.8) and median OS was 5.0 months (95% CI=3.0–not estimable) (PMID: 26028255). Additionally, in the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067) study of pembrolizumab in 233 patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced non-CRC, among nineteen patients with SBA, the ORR was 42.1% (95% CI=20.3–66.5) with three complete responses (15.8%) and five partial responses (26.3%) (PMID: 31682550).",POLE,k425r,"{'id': 903, 'code': '', 'color': 'SaddleBrown', 'name': '', 'mainType': {'id': None, 'name': 'Small Bowel Cancer', 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}, 'tissue': 'Bowel', 'children': {}, 'parent': None, 'level': 0, 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}"
