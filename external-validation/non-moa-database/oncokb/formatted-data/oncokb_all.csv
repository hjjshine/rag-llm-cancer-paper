FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase II trial of lorlatinib in 215 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in which the overall response rate was 48% and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. In patients with measurable brain metastases (n=89), the intracranial response rate was 60%, with a median duration of response of 19.5 months (PMID: 30413378). Responses were seen across various ALK mutations (PMID: 30413378), but most notably in G1202R-mutant tumors, which are resistant to first-generation ALK inhibitors (PMID: 27432227). In the Phase I trial of lorlatinib in patients with NSCLC with ALK or ROS rearrangements, four patients who harbored ALK G1202R mutation in addition to their ALK rearrangements had a clinical response to lorlatinib treatment (PMID: 29074098). In a Phase II clinical trial of lorlatinib in 198 patients with NSCLC, among patients who failed one or more second-generation ALK TKIs, lorlatinib showed greater efficacy in patients with ALK mutations compared to patients without ALK mutations (69% versus 27%), with progression-free survival for patients with ALK mutations significantly longer than for patients without ALK mutations (11 months vs 5.4 months, hazard ratio = 0.47) (PMID: 30892989). In the randomized, controlled Phase III CROWN trial evaluating lorlatinib versus crizotinib in previously untreated patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC with or without brain metastases (n=296), median progression-free survival in the lorlatinib arm (n=149) was not reached (95% CI = not reached-not reached) versus 9.3 months (95% CI = 7.6-11.1; p < .0001) with an objective response rate of 76% (95% CI = 68-83) versus 58% (95% CI = 7.6-11.1), respectively (PMID: 33207094). In the post-hoc analysis of the Phase III CROWN trial, median progression-free survival among patients without baseline brain metastases was not reached (95% CI = not reached–not reached) in the lorlatinib group (n=111) versus eleven months (95% CI = 9.0-14.6 months; HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.20–0.49; p < .0001) in the crizotinib group (n=107), and the median progression-free survival among patients with baseline brain metastases was not reached (95% CI = 18.2 months–not reached) in the lorlatinib group (n=38) versus 7.2 months (95% CI = 3.7–9.2 months) in the crizotinib group (n=40) (PMID: 35605188)."

Various individual case reports have demonstrated the sensitivity of these fusions to imatinib, as patients with MDS/MPD harboring PDGFRA fusions have had clinical responses, including complete hematological responses and complete molecular responses, upon treatment with imatinib (PMID: 14504092, 12660384, 17555450, 16498388, 16845659, 12944919, 15034867, 18950453)."

In total, case studies have indicated that about 45% of patients have complete responses to imatinib and 39% have major responses (PMID: 1516603, 12676775). In a long-term study of twelve patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders harboring PDGFRB fusions who were treated with imatinib, all patients showed a rapid response to treatment as measured by complete molecular and cytogenetic remission, and the median duration of cytogenetic responses was 47 months with only two patients progressing to relapse and death (PMID: 16960151)."
