NCCN recommendation is based on evidence showing activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC with MET amplification or exon 14 skipping mutations (PMID: 21623265). In a study of twelve evaluable patients with c-MET-amplified NSCLC, four patients had partial responses (33%) with a median duration of response of 35 weeks (Abstract: Camidge et al. Abstract# 8001, ASCO 2014. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/132030-144). In another study of four patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, three patients who were treated with crizotinib had a partial response to therapy (PMID: 25971939). A retrospective analysis also identified a patient with lung cancer harboring amplification of a mutant MET allele who had a major partial response to crizotinib (PMID: 26729443). In an open-label, multicenter phase I trial (NCT00585195) of crizotinib in 38 patients with MET-amplified NSCLC, the overall response rate was 28.9% (11/38; 95% CI= 15.4–45.9), with two (5.3%) patients achieving a complete response, nine patients (23.7%) achieving a partial response, eleven (28.9%) having stable disease, and eight (21.1%) having progressive disease, and the overall median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI= 1.9–7.0) (PMID: 33676017). In a phase II prospective, multicenter two-arm trial (METROS, NCT02499614) evaluating the efficacy of crizotinib in 52 patients with pretreated, MET-deregulated (cohort B) NSCLC, the objective response rate was 27%, median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95% CI= 3.0–5.8), and overall survival was 5.4 months (95% CI= 4.2–6.5)(PMID: 31416808)."
