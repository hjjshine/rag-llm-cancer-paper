In a clinical cohort of 48 evaluable patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, ERCC2 mutation was associated with response to therapy (odds ratio, 8.3; 95% CI=1.4-91.4; P = .01) and a statistically significant increase in overall survival (p = 0.03) compared to patients lacking ERCC2 mutations (PMID: 27310333). In a retrospective “extreme responder” analysis of 50 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who were treated with cisplatin, ERCC2 mutations within or near the conserved helicase motif were associated with complete response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (PMID: 25096233). In vitro studies using cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER), the pathway in which ERCC1 and ERCC2 function, showed that defective NER was associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin (PMID: 12208738). A xenograft model using ERCC2-deficient KU19-19 bladder cells demonstrated that loss of ERCC2 results in cisplatin sensitivity, as tumors resulting from ERCC2-deficient cells were cisplatin sensitive while wildtype cells were not (PMID: 29980530)."
