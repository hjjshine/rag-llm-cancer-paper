Abstract# 4000, ASCO 2020. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.4000). In an open-label, phase II study (DESTINY-CRC01, NCT03384940) of trastuzumab deruxtecan in 53 evaluable patients with HER2-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed on two or more previous regimens, the objective response rate was 45.3% (95% CI=31·6–59·6), with one (2%) patient achieving a complete response, 23 (43%) achieving a partial response, twenty (38%) achieving stable disease, and five (9%) exhibiting disease progression (PMID: 33961795)."
