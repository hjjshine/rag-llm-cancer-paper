Approval was based on the open-label, multicenter, phase II trial of tazemetostat in 99 patients with mutant (n=45) or wildtype (n=54) EZH2 relapsed or refractory FL in which the objective response rate was 77% (95% CI= 61.4-88.2) in the EZH2 mutant group versus 34% (95% CI=21.5-48.3) in the EZH2 wildtype group, with median progression-free survival of 11.1 months (95% CI=8.4-15.7) versus 5.7 (95% CI=3.5-11.1) months, respectively (PMID: 33035457)."
