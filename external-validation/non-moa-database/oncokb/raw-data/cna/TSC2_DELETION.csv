FDA approval is based on the results of a Phase III clinical trial of everolimus in patients with SEGA associated with TSC in which 35% of patients receiving everolimus (27 of 78 patients) experienced a reduction of at least 50% in the total volume of all targetable SEGAs versus no patients in the placebo group (PMID: 23158522). Patients in the everolimus group responded to the drug irrespective of whether they had a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation, although a higher percentage of patients with TSC1 mutations responded (five of ten patients, 50%) compared to those with TSC2 mutations (sixteen of 55 patients, 29%) (PMID: 23158522). In the Phase II PNOC001 trial of everolimus for 65 patients with progressive/recurrent pediatric low-grade glioma, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation did not correlate with clinical outcomes as the median progression-free survival in active pathways was 11.2 months versus 11.1 months in non active pathways (P = 0.80) (PMID: 37978951)."
