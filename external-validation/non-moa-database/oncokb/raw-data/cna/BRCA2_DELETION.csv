In a separate Phase II trial of rucaparib as maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive pancreatic cancer harboring BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations, seven of nineteen patients evaluable at interim analysis had a response to rucaparib (complete response, n=1; partial response, n=6; overall response rate = 36.8%), with responses seen in four patients with germline BRCA2 mutations, two patients with germline PALB2 mutations and one patient with somatic BRCA2 mutation (Abstract: Reiss Binder et al. Abstract# CT234, AACR 2019. https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/13_Supplement/CT234). In vitro studies in pancreatic cancer cell lines demonstrated that PARP inhibition in combination with chemotherapy was more effective at inhibiting pancreatic cell growth in vitro or in xenograft models compared to chemotherapy alone (PMID: 17444865). (PMID: 33970687, 34351646) In a Phase II study to assess maintenance rucaparib treatment and reversion mutations in 42 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer harboring germline or somatic variants in BRCA1/2 or PALB2, the progression-free survival for patients with progression with no KRAS reversion mutations (n=23) compared to progression with acquired KRAS reversion mutations (n=5) was 279 days (95% CI, 225 to 428) versus 112 days (95% CI, 46 to 156) and the median overall survival rate was 701 days (95% CI, 586 to 829) versus 283 days (95% CI, 128 to 436), respectively (Abstract: Brown et al.
