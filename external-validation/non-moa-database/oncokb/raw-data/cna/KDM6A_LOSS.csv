In vitro studies show that KDM6A mutation can sensitize to EZH2 inhibition as measured by decreased cell proliferation, viability and dedifferentiation of KDM6A-null multiple myeloma and bladder cancer cell lines and tumors in both patient-derived and cell line xenograft models. Additionally, EZH2 inhibition was shown to partially restore gene expression regulation mediated by KDM6A loss (PMID: 28228601, 29045832, 24123378)."
