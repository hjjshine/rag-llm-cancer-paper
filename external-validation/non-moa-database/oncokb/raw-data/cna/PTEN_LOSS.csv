FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III CAPItello-291 trial of capivasertib plus fulvestrant in adult patients with or without AKT pathway-altered (PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN) ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Of the patients with only PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN-mutant tumors (n=289), the capivasertib plus fulvestrant group (n=155) demonstrated an objective response rate of 26% (95% CI=19, 34), with a 2.3% complete response rate and 23% partial response rate, and a median progression-free survival of 7.3 months (95% CI=5.5, 9.0) whereas the placebo plus fulvestrant group (n=134) demonstrated an objective response rate of 8% (95% CI=4, 14), with a 8% partial response rate, and a median progression-free survival of 3.1 months (95% CI=2.0, 3.7) (HR=0.50 [95% CI=0.38, 0.65]; P<0.0001) (PMID: 37256976). Of all patients, including patients with wildtype tumors and patients with PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN-mutant tumors (n=708), the capivasertib plus fulvestrant group (n=355) demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 7.2 months (95% CI=5.5, 7.4) whereas the placebo plus fulvestrant group (n=353) demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 3.6 months (95% CI=2.8, 3.7) (HR=0.60 [95% CI=0.51, 0.71]; P<0.001) (PMID: 37256976)."
