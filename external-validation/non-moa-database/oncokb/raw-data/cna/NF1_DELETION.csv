FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase IIb ReNeu (NCT03962543) trial of mirdametinib in adult and pediatric patients with symptomatic NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma.

In the Phase IIb ReNeu (NCT03962543) trial, the adult cohort (n=58 [age range=18-69 years old; median age=34 years old]) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 41% (95% CI=29-55) (p<0.001), with 24 patients demonstrating partial responses (PR) and 26 patients demonstrating stable disease (SD) (PMID: 39514826). In the pediatric cohort (n=56 [age range=2-17 years old; median age=10 years old]), the ORR was 52% (95% CI=38-65) (p<0.001), with 29 patients demonstrating PR and 22 patients demonstrating SD (PMID: 39514826)."

In a prior phase I trial of selumetinib in children with NF1 who had inoperable PN, seventeen of 24 (71%) children had a partial response (PMID: 28029918). In vivo studies in a mouse model of NF1 demonstrated tumor regression in twelve of eighteen mice (67%) upon treatment with selumetinib (PMID: 28029918)."
