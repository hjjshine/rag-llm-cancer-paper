Phase I clinical trials of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory SMARCB1-negative tumors showed durable responses, including complete responses, in eight (38%) of 21 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (5%) of 43 patients with solid tumors and four (9%) of 46 patients with SMARCB1-negative tumors (Abstract: Chi et al.

Cell line and xenograft studies demonstrate that SMARCB1-depleted tumors, including SMARCB1-null malignant rhabdoid tumors and SS18-SSX fusion-positive synovial sarcomas, are sensitive to tazemetostat treatment as shown by inhibition of proliferation and increased differentiation (PMID: 23620515, 20951942, 27391784)."
