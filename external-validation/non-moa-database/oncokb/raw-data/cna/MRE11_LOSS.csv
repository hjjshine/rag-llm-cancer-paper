Of patients with HRR gene mutations (n=399), the radiographic progression-free survival in the talazoparib plus enzalutamide group (n=200) was not evaluable (95% CI=21.9, NE) compared to 13.8 months (95% CI=11.0, 16.7) in the placebo plus enzalutamide group (n=199) (HR=0.45; 95% CI=0.33, 0.61), with a 2-sided p-value of <0.0001 (PMID: 37285865). Hazard ratios and p-values were not calculated for patients harboring MRE11 mutations as the number of patients per treatment group was too small for evaluation (PMID: 37285865)."
