FDA approval was based on the results of three multicenter, single-arm, clinical trials. In two Phase I clinical trials conducted in a cohort of 119 patients with diverse solid tumors displaying molecular alterations involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK, treatment with entrectinib showed clinical responses only in patients that were naive to prior treatment with inhibitors targeting these genes, such as crizotinib, ceritinib or alectinib. Three of three patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged advanced solid tumors responded to entrectinib; durations of response were 2.6 months, 4.6 months and 15.1 months, respectively. Additionally, in two patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, entrectinib demonstrated potent activity as evidenced by a complete intracranial response achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer and a substantial reduction in disease burden in an additional patient with a glioneuronal tumor harboring an NTRK1 rearrangement (PMID: 28183697). At a later evaluation, the overall response rate of the trials was 57.4% (95% CI= 43.2 - 70.8), including four (7.4%) complete responses, with an overall median duration of response of 10.4 months and median overall survival of 20.9 months (95% CI= 14.9 - NR) (Abstract: Demetri et al.

In two Phase I clinical trials conducted in a cohort of 119 patients with diverse solid tumors displaying molecular alterations involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK, treatment with entrectinib showed clinical responses only in patients that were naive to prior treatment with inhibitors targeting these genes, such as crizotinib, ceritinib or alectinib. Three of three patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged advanced solid tumors responded to entrectinib; durations of response were 2.6 months, 4.6 months and 15.1 months, respectively. Additionally, in two patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, entrectinib demonstrated potent activity as evidenced by a complete intracranial response achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer and a substantial reduction in disease burden in an additional patient with a glioneuronal tumor harboring an NTRK1 rearrangement (PMID: 28183697). At a later evaluation, the overall response rate of the trials was 57.4% (95% CI= 43.2 - 70.8), including four (7.4%) complete responses, with an overall median duration of response of 10.4 months and median overall survival of 20.9 months (95% CI= 14.9 - NR) (Abstract: Demetri et al.

FDA approval was based on the results of three multicenter, single-arm, clinical trials. In two Phase I clinical trials conducted in a cohort of 119 patients with diverse solid tumors displaying molecular alterations involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK, treatment with entrectinib showed clinical responses only in patients that were naive to prior treatment with inhibitors targeting these genes, such as crizotinib, ceritinib or alectinib. Three of three patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged advanced solid tumors responded to entrectinib; durations of response were 2.6 months, 4.6 months and 15.1 months, respectively. Additionally, in two patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, entrectinib demonstrated potent activity as evidenced by a complete intracranial response achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer and a substantial reduction in disease burden in an additional patient with a glioneuronal tumor harboring an NTRK1 rearrangement (PMID: 28183697). At a later evaluation, the overall response rate of the trials was 57.4% (95% CI= 43.2 - 70.8), including four (7.4%) complete responses, with an overall median duration of response of 10.4 months and median overall survival of 20.9 months (95% CI= 14.9 - NR) (Abstract: Demetri et al. Abstract# LBA17, ESMO 2018 Congress. https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/29/suppl_8/mdy424.017/5141583)(Abstract: Rolfo et al. Abstract# 65P, ESMO 2019. https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/30/Supplement_9/mdz420.004/5638407). Two patients with pancreatic cancer harboring NTRK fusions who were treated with entrectinib had clinical improvement lasting for more than one year (Abstract: Pishvaian et al. Abstract# 521, Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium, 2018. https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/155954/abstract). In an analysis of the ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2 trials of entrectinib with 51 evaluable patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer, the objective response rate was 62.7% (95% CI: 48.1-75.9), with six complete and 26 partial responses, the median duration of response was 27.3 months (95% CI: 19.9-30.9), the median progression-free survival was 28.0 months (95% CI: 15.7-30.4) and the median overall survival was 41.5 months (PMID: 38171156)."
