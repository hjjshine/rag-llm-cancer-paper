Cabozantinib has demonstrated activity in advanced lung adenocarcinoma with RET translocations (PMID: 23533264). NCCN recommendation is based on the results of an open-label Phase II trial of cabozantinib in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC in which seven of 25 response-assessable patients had a partial response to treatment (overall response rate = 28%) while the remaining eighteen patients had stable disease with a mean progression-free survival of 5.5 months (PMID: 27825636). Of the patients in the Phase II trial who had a partial response, three had KIF5B-RET fusions, one had a TRIM3-RET fusion, one had a CLIP1-RET fusion, and two had FISH-positive RET fusions with unknown partners (PMID: 27825636). Results from the global, multicenter RET registry demonstrated that of 21 RET fusion-positive patients with NSCLC who were treated with cabozantinib, one patient had a complete response, six patients had partial response and five patients had stable disease (PMID: 28447912)."
