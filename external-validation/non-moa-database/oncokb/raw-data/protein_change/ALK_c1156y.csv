In several case reports, patients with this mutation progressed on crizotinib. In a clinical study of 13 patients with EML4-ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that relapsed on crizotinib therapy (duration of crizotinib therapy averaged ten to eleven months before relapse), one patient acquired an EML4-ALK C1156Y alteration at relapse (PMID: 23434628). In a second case study, a patient with EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC had a partial response to crizotinib therapy for five months before relapse due to the C1156Y alteration (PMID: 20979473). Another patient with NSCLC achieved a clinical response to crizotinib for 18 months before relapse due to the acquisition of the C1156Y alteration (PMID: 26698910). Similarly, a patient with EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC responded to crizotinib for 7 months before developing an ALK C1156Y mutation and progressing (PMID: 27045755). Hematopoietic and fibroblast cells engineered to express this mutation were insensitive to crizotinib therapy, as evidenced by pathway activation, increased proliferation, and tumor growth in xenograft assays (PMID: 22235099, 24675041, 26698910, 26144315)."
