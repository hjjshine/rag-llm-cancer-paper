Eligible PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-alterations (PIK3CA R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545A, E545D, E545Q, E545K, E545G, Q546E, Q546K, Q546R, Q546P, M1043V, M1043I, H1047Y, H1047R, H1047L and G1049R; AKT1 E17K; all PTEN oncogenic mutations) for treatment with capivasertib plus fulvestrant were detected by the FoundationOne CDx assay. FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III CAPItello-291 (NCT04305496) trial of capivasertib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in 708 adult patients with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (n=289, patients with eligible PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-alterations [76% with PIK3CA alterations, 13% with AKT1 alterations, 17% with PTEN alterations]). In the Phase III CAPItello-291 (NCT04305496) trial, the capivasertib plus fulvestrant cohort with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors (n=155) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 26% (95% CI=19-34), with a 2.3% complete response (CR) rate, 23% partial response (PR) rate, and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.3 months (95% CI=5.5-9.0)(PMID: 37256976). The placebo plus fulvestrant cohort with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors (n=134) demonstrated an ORR of 8% (95% CI=4-14), with an 8% PR rate and a median PFS of 3.1 months (95% CI=2.0-3.7) (HR=0.50 [95% CI=0.38-0.65]; p<0.0001) (PMID: 37256976)."

In a Phase I (NCT01226316) basket study of capivasertib in AKT E17K-mutated cancers, capivasertib treatment induced partial responses (PR) in two patients with endometrial cancer and one patient with cervical cancer, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.6 months (PMID: 28489509). In a second Phase I (NCT01353781) study of 41 patients with solid tumors in Japan, two patients with the AKT E17K mutation, one having breast cancer and the other having ovarian cancer, demonstrated PR to capivasertib (PMID: 26351323). In the Phase II NCI-MATCH subprotocol EAY131-Y (NCT04439123) trial of capivasertib in patients with AKT1 E17K-mutated metastatic tumors (n= 3, patients with ovarian cancer), one patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response and remained on therapy for >35.6 months (PMID: 33377972). 
In vitro studies of breast cancer explants harboring the AKT E17K mutation have shown that capivasertib inhibits tumor growth and reduces signaling downstream of AKT, including reduced phosphorylation of PRAS40 and S6 (PMID: 22294718)."
