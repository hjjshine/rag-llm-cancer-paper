FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878)."

However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492).
