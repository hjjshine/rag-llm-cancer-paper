FDA approval was based on results from the Phase I/II study of enasidenib in 239 patients with mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid malignancies in which the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to enasidenib treatment was 40.3% and the overall survival of patients with refractory disease or those with complete remissions after enasidenib treatment was 9.3 months or 19.7 months, respectively (PMID: 28588020). Overall response also varied by IDH2 mutation, with the ORR for patients with IDH2 R140 mutations (n=130) being 35.4% and for those with IDH2 R172 mutations (n=45) being 53.3% (PMID: 28588020). Older patients with newly-diagnosed IDH2-mutant AML have also demonstrated benefit from treatment with enasidenib (PMID: 30967620)."
