MET single nucleotide variants and indels that lead to MET exon 14 skipping were detected for treatment with capmatinib by the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx. FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase II GEOMETRY mono-1 (NCT02414139) study of capmatinib in 97 patients with MET exon 14 skipping NSCLC that were either treatment-naive or previously treated. In the Phase II GEOMETRY mono-1 (NCT02414139) study, the treatment-naive cohort (n=28) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% (95% CI=48-84), with a 4% complete response (CR) rate and 64% partial response (PR) rate, and a median duration of response (DOR) of 12.6 months (95% CI=5.5-25.3) (PMID: 38593348). In contrast, the previously treated cohort (n=69) demonstrated an ORR of 41% (95% CI=29-53), with a 41% PR rate, and a median DOR of 9.7 months (95% CI=5.5-13.0) (PMID: 38593348). 

In the final analysis of the Phase II GEOMETRY mono-1 (NCT02414139) trial, the treatment-naive cohort (n=6) demonstrated an ORR of 68% (95% CI=55.0-79.7), with a 5% CR rate, 63% PR rate and 36% stable disease (SD) rate, a median DOR of 16.6 months (95% CI=8.4-22.1), a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 12.5 months (95% CI=8.3-18.0) and a median overall survival (OS) of 21.4 months (95% CI=15.2-30.5) (PMID: 39362249). In contrast, the previously treated cohort (n=100) demonstrated an ORR of 44%, with a 1% CR rate, 43% PR rate and 36% SD rate, a median DOR of 9.7 months (95% CI=5.6-13.0), a median PFS of 5.5 months (95% CI=4.2-8.1) and a median OS of 16.8 months (95% CI=11.6-23.8) (PMID: 39362249)."

NCCN recommendation is based on evidence showing activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC with MET amplification or exon 14 skipping mutations (PMID: 21623265). In a study of twelve evaluable patients with c-MET amplified NSCLC, four patients had partial responses (33%) with a median duration of response of 35 weeks (Abstract: Camidge et al. Abstract# 8001, ASCO 2014. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/132030-144). In another study of four patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, three patients who were treated with crizotinib had a partial response to therapy (PMID: 25971939). A retrospective analysis also identified a patient with lung cancer harboring amplification of a mutant MET allele who had a major partial response to crizotinib (PMID: 26729443). In a study of crizotinib in 26 patients with MET-altered NSCLC, the objective response rate was 27%, median progression-free survival at the time of cutoff was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.0-5.8), and overall survival was 5.4 months (95% CI= 4.2-6.5) (PMID: 31416808). In a study of crizotinib in patients with MET exon 14-altered NSCLC, the overall response rate in the 65 tumor-evaluable patients was 32% (95% CI= 21-45) with three patients (5%) achieving a confirmed complete response, eighteen (28%) achieving a confirmed partial response and 29 (45%) achieving stable disease (PMID: 31932802)."
