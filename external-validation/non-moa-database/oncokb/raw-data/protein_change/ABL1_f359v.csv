In a retrospective study of 26 evaluable newly diagnosed elderly patients with Ph+ ALL who enrolled in the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trial ADE10, BCR-ABL KD mutations were found in 21/26 patients (84%), including G250E (n = 5/21), Y253H (n = 2/21), E255K/V (n = 4/21), and F317L (n = 1/21) (PMID: 17405907). Upon sequencing the bone marrow of nine patients with Ph+ ALL who were treated with STI571 (imatinib) and developed resistance, 6/9 patients harbored the E255K mutation, which is located within the motif important for forming the pocket of the ATP-binding site in ABL (PMID: 11861307)."
