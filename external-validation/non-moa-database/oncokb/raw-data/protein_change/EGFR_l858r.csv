In a phase I dose-escalation/expansion study (NCT03260491) of HER3-DXd in 57 patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n=33 with Exon 19 deletion), the objective response rate (ORR) was 39% (95% CI=26.0–52.4) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 (95% CI=4.4–8.3) months (PMID: 34548309). In the phase II HERTHENA-Lung01 trial of HER3-DXd in 225 patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated NSCLC, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI=5.1-5.9) and an objective response was observed in 67 patients (29.8%; 95% CI=23.9-36.2), with complete response observed in one patient (PMID: 37689979). In preclinical studies, in vitro and in vivo models containing HER3-expressing CM-3 cancer cells treated with U3-1402 (HER3-DXd) exhibited reduced cell viability and tumor volume, respectively (PMID: 31661465). In the Phase I U31402-A-U102 (NCT03260491) trial of HER3-DXd in 97 patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had received prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy (n=64, exon 19 deletion; n=29, L858R; n=4, G719A; n=2, L861Q; n=1, exon 19 insertion), the cohort demonstrated an ORR of 39.2% (n=38) (95% CI=29.4-49.6), with a 1% (n=1) confirmed response rate, 38.1% (n=37) partial response rate, 40.2% (n=39) stable disease rate and 12.4% (n=12) progressive disease rate, a median duration of response of 9.6 months (95% CI=6.9-15.4), a median PFS of 6.4 months (95% CI=4.9-8.3) and a median overall survival of 15.8 months (95% CI=10.8-21.5) (PMID: 38369013)."
