FDA approval is based on the results of the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) and Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trials of Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
In the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) trial of Dato-DXd in patients with NSCLC harboring actionable alterations progressing on or after targeted therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=78 [exon 19 deletion: 41 (29.9%); exon 20 T790M: 26 (19.0%); exon 21 L858R: 25 (18.2%); exon 18 G719: 5 (3.6%); exon 21 L861Q: 3 (2.2%); exon 20 insertion: 2 (1.5%)]) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 43.6% (95% CI=32.4-55.3), with a 5.1% (n=4) complete response (CR) rate, 38.5% (n=30) partial response (PR) rate and 34.6% (n=27) stable disease (SD) rate, a disease control rate (DCR) of 82.1% (95% CI=71.7-89.8), a median duration of response (DOR) of 7.0 months (95% CI=4.2-10.2) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.8 months (95% CI=5.4-8.3) (PMID: 39761483).
In the Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trial of Dato-DXd versus docetaxel in patients with pretreated NSCLC, patients treated with Dato-DXd (n=299 [EGFR mutations: 39 (13.0%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 26.4% (95% CI= 21.5-31.8), with a 1.3% (n=4) CR rate, 25.1% (n=75) PR rate and 49.8% (n=149) SD rate, a DCR of 77.3% (95% CI=72.1-81.9), a median DOR of 7.1 months (95% CI=5.6-10.9), a median PFS of 4.4 months (95% CI=4.2-5.6) and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.9 months (95% CI=11.0-13.9) (PMID: 39250535). Patients treated with docetaxel (n=305 [EGFR mutations: 45 (14.8%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 12.8% (95% CI=9.3-17.1), with a 12.8% (n=39) PR rate and 50.2% (n=153) SD rate, a DCR of 64.9% (95% CI=59.3-70.3), a median DOR of 5.6 months (95% CI=5.4-8.1), a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI=2.9-4.2) (HR=0.75 [95% CI=0.62-0.91]; p=.004) and a median OS of 11.8 months (95% CI=10.1-12.8) (HR=0.94 [95% CI=0.78-1.14]; p=0.530) (PMID: 39250535)."

In vitro studies of Ba/F3 cells transfected with E709_T710delinsD, a rare mutation in exon 18 of EGFR, demonstrated sensitivity to afatinib with an IC50 of 1.7 nmol/L, a finding that was further supported in the clinic when a single patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring E709_T710delinsD was treated with afatinib and experienced substantial tumor shrinkage (PMID: 26206867). In a separate single-patient study, another stage IV NSCLC patient with the E709_T710delinsD mutation was treated with and responded well to afatinib, resulting in progression-free survival of eleven months and overall survival that exceeded 21 months (PMID: 31686847). In a third single-patient study, a 56-year-old female patient with advanced NSCLC harboring the E709_T710delinsD mutation was treated with afatinib as a sixth-line treatment for seven months, during which time the size of her pulmonary lesion significantly reduced until her disease progressed and treatment was stopped (PMiD: 31187861). A fourth case report of a 52-year-old female with bilateral advanced NSCLC harboring the delE709_T710insD mutation demonstrated significant clinical and radiographic responses to treatment with afatinib (PMID: 28625646)."
