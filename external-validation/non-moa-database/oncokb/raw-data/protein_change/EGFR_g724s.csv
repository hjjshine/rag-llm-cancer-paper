FDA approval is based on the results of the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) and Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trials of Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
In the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) trial of Dato-DXd in patients with NSCLC harboring actionable alterations progressing on or after targeted therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=78 [exon 19 deletion: 41 (29.9%); exon 20 T790M: 26 (19.0%); exon 21 L858R: 25 (18.2%); exon 18 G719: 5 (3.6%); exon 21 L861Q: 3 (2.2%); exon 20 insertion: 2 (1.5%)]) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 43.6% (95% CI=32.4-55.3), with a 5.1% (n=4) complete response (CR) rate, 38.5% (n=30) partial response (PR) rate and 34.6% (n=27) stable disease (SD) rate, a disease control rate (DCR) of 82.1% (95% CI=71.7-89.8), a median duration of response (DOR) of 7.0 months (95% CI=4.2-10.2) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.8 months (95% CI=5.4-8.3) (PMID: 39761483).
In the Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trial of Dato-DXd versus docetaxel in patients with pretreated NSCLC, patients treated with Dato-DXd (n=299 [EGFR mutations: 39 (13.0%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 26.4% (95% CI= 21.5-31.8), with a 1.3% (n=4) CR rate, 25.1% (n=75) PR rate and 49.8% (n=149) SD rate, a DCR of 77.3% (95% CI=72.1-81.9), a median DOR of 7.1 months (95% CI=5.6-10.9), a median PFS of 4.4 months (95% CI=4.2-5.6) and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.9 months (95% CI=11.0-13.9) (PMID: 39250535). Patients treated with docetaxel (n=305 [EGFR mutations: 45 (14.8%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 12.8% (95% CI=9.3-17.1), with a 12.8% (n=39) PR rate and 50.2% (n=153) SD rate, a DCR of 64.9% (95% CI=59.3-70.3), a median DOR of 5.6 months (95% CI=5.4-8.1), a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI=2.9-4.2) (HR=0.75 [95% CI=0.62-0.91]; p=.004) and a median OS of 11.8 months (95% CI=10.1-12.8) (HR=0.94 [95% CI=0.78-1.14]; p=0.530) (PMID: 39250535)."

Non-resistant EGFR mutations were identified using either Sanger sequencing or by the therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR Kit. In a case report, two patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion and G724S post-osimertinib treatment were treated with afatinib and demonstrated partial response (PMID: 32093857). In a second case report, one patient with meningeal metastasis harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion and G724S was treated with afatinib and demonstrated clinical benefit with a progression-free survival of at least eight months (PMID: 33209641). In a third case report, eight patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR G724S and other EGFR mutations (n=2 patients were treatment-naive [n=1, co-occurring mutation with EGFR S768I; n=1, co-occurring mutation with EGFR N771dup and EGFR amplification], n=1 patient progressed on gefitinib [n=1, co-occurring mutation with EGFR S768I], n=5 patients progressed on osimertinib [n=5, co-occurring mutation with EGFR exon 19 deletion]) were treated with afatinib and achieved stable disease (PMID: 34590038). Preclinical studies of cells expressing EGFR G724S and exon 19 deletion demonstrate sensitivity to afatinib (PMID: 30405134)."
['G724S'],"[{'ncitCode': 'C116377', 'drugName': 'Osimertinib'}]",[],LEVEL_R2,LEVEL_Fda3,"{'id': 876, 'code': '', 'color': 'Gainsboro', 'name': '', 'mainType': {'id': None, 'name': 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer', 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}, 'tissue': 'Lung', 'children': {}, 'parent': None, 'level': 0, 'tumorForm': 'SOLID'}",[],"['30796031', '28838405', '30228210', '35979997', '30405134']",[],"Osimertinib is an orally available, small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR T790M that is FDA-approved for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations and for adult patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy, as detected by an FDA-approved test. EGFR mutational status was identified through the cobas EGFR Mutation Test. The EGFR G742S mutation has been identified as an acquired resistance mutation to osimertinib, including in two cases of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, in two additional patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion-mutant NSCLC and in five additional patients with EGFR G724S-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, with loss of the T790M allele accompanying progression in these patients (PMID: 28838405, 30228210, 35979997, 30405134). Preclinical studies with cells expressing EGFR G724S demonstrate resistance to osimertinib in vitro and in vivo (PMID: 30405134). Expression in combination with either an EGFR exon 19 deletion or the EGFR L858R mutation in HEK293 cells demonstrated that the G724S mutation significantly reduced osimertinib affinity for the EGFR exon 19 deletion while not affecting the ability of osimertinib to bind to or inhibit the EGFR L858R mutation (PMID: 30796031)."
