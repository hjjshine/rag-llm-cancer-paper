In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with plixorafenib and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. In a phase I/IIa trial of plixorafenib for patients with BRAF-altered, advanced solid or CNS tumors (n=110; n=61, patients with class 1 mutations; n=19, patients with class 2 mutations [excluding fusions]; n=17, patients with BRAF fusions), partial response was achieved in 39% (n=9/23) of patients with MAPKi-naive, V600-mutant tumors, with a median duration of response (DoR) of 32 months, and in 18% (n=3/17) of patients with MAPKi treated, V600-mutant tumors (n=6, patients with V600-mutant glioma; n=3, patients with V600-mutant ovarian cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant small bowel cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant papillary thyroid cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer) (Abstract: Fuente et al.

Preclinical studies show that plixorafenib specifically inhibits BRAF-containing dimers and inhibits proliferation and pathway activation in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines (PMID: 26466569, 28659148, 30559419, 28783719)."
