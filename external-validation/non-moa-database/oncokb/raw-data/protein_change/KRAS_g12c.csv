Small case studies have also demonstrated the clinical efficacy of MEK inhibition in patients with histiocytic neoplasms (PMID: 29236635). In a case study of one eighteen-year-old patient with refractory histiocytic sarcoma harboring a pathogenic variant of MAP2K1 (F53L), the patient was treated with trametinib and showed an excellent response prior to treatment interruption due to severe adverse events (PMID: 30361829)."
