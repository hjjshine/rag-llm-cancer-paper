In a study of 308 patients with CLL who enrolled on four sequential clinical trials of ibrutinib, one patient had three separate mutations in BTK (C481Y, C481R, L528W) at disease progression and the C481Y allele frequency was 29% (PMID: 27282255, 26182309). In a study of nine CLL patients with ibrutinib-relapsed disease, two patients harbored C481Y mutations that were the major clone with a cancer cell fraction of 100% and 56.7%, respectively (PMID: 29296715)."
