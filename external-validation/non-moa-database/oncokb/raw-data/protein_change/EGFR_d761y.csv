FDA approval is based on the results of the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) and Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trials of Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
In the Phase II TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) trial of Dato-DXd in patients with NSCLC harboring actionable alterations progressing on or after targeted therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=78 [exon 19 deletion: 41 (29.9%); exon 20 T790M: 26 (19.0%); exon 21 L858R: 25 (18.2%); exon 18 G719: 5 (3.6%); exon 21 L861Q: 3 (2.2%); exon 20 insertion: 2 (1.5%)]) demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 43.6% (95% CI=32.4-55.3), with a 5.1% (n=4) complete response (CR) rate, 38.5% (n=30) partial response (PR) rate and 34.6% (n=27) stable disease (SD) rate, a disease control rate (DCR) of 82.1% (95% CI=71.7-89.8), a median duration of response (DOR) of 7.0 months (95% CI=4.2-10.2) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.8 months (95% CI=5.4-8.3) (PMID: 39761483).
In the Phase III TROPION-Lung01 (NCT04656652) trial of Dato-DXd versus docetaxel in patients with pretreated NSCLC, patients treated with Dato-DXd (n=299 [EGFR mutations: 39 (13.0%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 26.4% (95% CI= 21.5-31.8), with a 1.3% (n=4) CR rate, 25.1% (n=75) PR rate and 49.8% (n=149) SD rate, a DCR of 77.3% (95% CI=72.1-81.9), a median DOR of 7.1 months (95% CI=5.6-10.9), a median PFS of 4.4 months (95% CI=4.2-5.6) and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.9 months (95% CI=11.0-13.9) (PMID: 39250535). Patients treated with docetaxel (n=305 [EGFR mutations: 45 (14.8%)]) demonstrated an ORR of 12.8% (95% CI=9.3-17.1), with a 12.8% (n=39) PR rate and 50.2% (n=153) SD rate, a DCR of 64.9% (95% CI=59.3-70.3), a median DOR of 5.6 months (95% CI=5.4-8.1), a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI=2.9-4.2) (HR=0.75 [95% CI=0.62-0.91]; p=.004) and a median OS of 11.8 months (95% CI=10.1-12.8) (HR=0.94 [95% CI=0.78-1.14]; p=0.530) (PMID: 39250535)."

Clinical and in vitro studies have shown that the EGFR D716Y mutation confers resistance to first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib (PMID: 17085664). Expression of EGFR D761Y along with EGFR L858R in cell lines has demonstrated that this mutation retains sensitivity to osimertinib as measured by inhibited proliferation and attenuated pathway activation upon drug treatment (PMID: 28424065)."
