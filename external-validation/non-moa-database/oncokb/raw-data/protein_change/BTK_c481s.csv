Whole-exome sequencing performed at baseline and time of relapse on samples from six CLL patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy revealed a C481S mutation in five of six patients, and subsequent functional analyses have shown that ibrutinib is significantly less effective at inhibiting cell growth and blocking BTK autophosphorylation and downstream signaling (as indicated by pERK levels) in cells with C481S compared to wildtype (WT) BTK (PMID: 24869598, 27282255, 27626698). In a study of 308 patients with CLL who enrolled in four sequential clinical trials of ibrutinib, eight patients relapsed, all of whom harbored a C491S mutation with an expansion of the clone before relapse (PMID: 28418267). In a phase II study (NCT01500733) of 86 patients treated with single-agent ibrutinib, fifteen patients progressed, of whom seven had a C481S mutation (PMID: 28049639). In a study of nine CLL patients with ibrutinib-relapsed disease, two patients harbored a C481S mutation that was the major clone with a cancer cell fraction of 97% and 90.7%, respectively (PMID: 29296715)."
