Two further Phase III studies of imatinib in 946 or 694 patients, respectively, with KIT-expressing malignant or unresectable GIST demonstrated a greater response rate in patients given 800mg imatinib versus 400mg, with complete response rates ranging from 44.6%-48.1% at the 800 mg dose versus 5.2%-5.3% at the 400mg dose (PMID: 18235122, 18955451). Long-term follow-up of these patients demonstrated a ten-year overall survival across both study arms of 22% (95% CI= 19.0-26.0), with patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutations having significantly shorter overall survival on imatinib than patients with KIT exon 11 mutations (p=0.0013) (PMID: 28196207)."
