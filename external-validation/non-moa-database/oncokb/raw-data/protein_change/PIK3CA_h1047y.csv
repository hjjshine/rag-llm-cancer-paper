FDA approval is based on data from the Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SOLAR-1 trial of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 patients with breast cancer in which the progression-free survival in patients with PIK3CA mutation (n=341) was eleven months (95% CI= 7.5-14.5) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.7-7.4) with placebo plus fulvestrant (HR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.5-0.85; p= 0.0013) compared to PIK3CA-wildtype patients in which the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.58-1.25) (PMID: 31091374). Overall response in the PIK3CA-mutant population was 35.7 months (95% CI= 27.4-44.7; n=126) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 16.2 months (95% CI= 10.4-23.5; n=136) with placebo plus fulvestrant (PMID: 31091374). Previous studies, including in vivo xenograft studies and a phase I trial, also demonstrated that treatment of ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer with the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib results in greater tumor shrinkage than either drug alone, with fulvestrant inhibiting the induction of ER-dependent gene transcription resulting from PI3Kα inhibition with alpelisib (PMID: 25877889, 30543347)."
