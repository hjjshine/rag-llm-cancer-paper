There are promising clinical data in patients with ALK F1245V-mutated neuroblastoma treated with lorlatinib. In the Phase I New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) Consortium (NANT2015-02) trial of lorlatinib in pediatric, adolescent and adult patients with ALK-driven refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma, cohort A1 (≥12 months old to <18 years old; n=25) and cohort A2 (≥18 years old; n=15) were treated with lorlatinib monotherapy and cohort B2 (≥12 months old to <18 years old; n=9) were treated with combination lorlatinib plus chemotherapy (PMID: 37012551). Amongst patients harboring ALK F1245V, cohort A1 (n=2, ALK F1245V) achieved one minor response and one stable disease response (PMID: 37012551)."
