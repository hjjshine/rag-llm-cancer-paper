In eight patients with this mutation, seven patients progressed on crizotinib and one patient progressed on ceritinib (PMID: 23344087, 22235099, 24675041, 27045755, 23434628, 28434515). The ALK G1269A mutation was detected in post-progression samples from patients with lung cancer that developed resistance to crizotinib after at least one prior line of therapy. All cases were negative for EGFR and KRAS alterations upon progression and the patients were on the drug for at least six months (PMID: 23344087, 22235099). In vitro studies have shown that the introduction of the ALK G1269A mutation into cell lines with the EML4-ALK fusion caused decreased crizotinib sensitivity compared to control cells harboring only the EML4-ALK fusion (PMID: 23344087)."
