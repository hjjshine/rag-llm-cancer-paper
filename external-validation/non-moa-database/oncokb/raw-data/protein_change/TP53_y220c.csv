In the Phase I PYNNACLE (NCT04585750) trial of rezatapopt in 29 patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation, one patient with small cell lung cancer and one patient with breast cancer each had a partial response to treatment (Abstract: Dumbrava et al. Abstract# 3003, ASCO 2022. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.3003). In an updated analysis of the Phase I/II PYNNACLE (NCT04585750) trial of rezatapopt in 61 patients with TP53 Y220C solid tumors, the overall response rate was 33.3% (n=12) in patients with TP53 Y220C and KRAS wildtype tumors, including ovarian, breast, prostate, small-cell lung and endometrial cancer, and the median duration of confirmed response was 7 months (Abstract: Schram et al. Abstract# LB_A25, AACR 2023. https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article/22/12_Supplement/LB_A25/730549/Abstract-LB-A25-Updated-Phase-1-results-from-the). The results of an updated subgroup analysis of the Phase I/II PYNNACLE (NCT04585750) trial of rezatapopt in heavily pretreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer (n=22), specifically those with TP53 Y220C and KRAS wildtype tumors, demonstrated that among fifteen evaluable patients, seven patients achieved partial response, seven had stable disease, and one had progressive disease, with an overall response rate of 47% and median duration of confirmed response of 7.0 months (Abstract: Schram et al. Abstract# LBA_26, SGO 2024. https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(24)00453-0/fulltext). In vivo xenograft studies with TP53 Y220C-mutant gastric cancer cell line NUGC3 and Y220C-mutant patient-derived xenografts demonstrated sensitivity to rezatapopt treatment as measured by dose-dependent tumor shrinkage and conversion of TP53 Y220C to the wildtype conformation (Abstract: Dumble et al. Abstract# LB006, AACR 2021. https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/13_Supplement/LB006/669897/Abstract-LB006-PC14586-The-first-orally)."
