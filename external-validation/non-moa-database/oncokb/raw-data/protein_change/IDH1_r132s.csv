In a real-world retrospective study of ivosidenib plus hypomethylating agent versus venetoclax plus hypomethylating agent in 283 patients with IDH1-mutant AML, the ivosidenib cohort (n=182) demonstrated a complete response of 42.9% and a median time to best response of 3.3 months versus 26.7% (p=0.007) and 4.1 months (p=0.02), respectively, in the venetoclax cohort (n=101) (Abstract: Smith et al.
