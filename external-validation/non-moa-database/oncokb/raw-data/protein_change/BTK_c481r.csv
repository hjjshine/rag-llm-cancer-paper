In a phase II study (NCT01500733) of 86 patients treated with single-agent ibrutinib, fifteen progressed, of which one had a subclonal C481R mutation with a variant allele frequency of 15.8% (PMID: 28049639, 29381098). In a review summarizing the mutational frequencies of clones in 29 CLL patients treated with ibrutinib with reported summed variant allele frequencies (VAFs) greater than 30%, three of 29 patients harbored a C481R mutation with VAFs of 2.5%, 15.8%, and 18.1%, respectively (PMID: 29381098). In a study of 308 patients with CLL who enrolled in four sequential clinical trials of ibrutinib, one patient had three separate mutations in BTK (C481Y, C481R, L528W) at disease progression, with a C481R allele frequency of 24% (PMID: 27282255). In vitro, ibrutinib demonstrated thirty-fold potency against C481R (IC50 = 23 nM) compared to wildtype BTK (PMID: 27571029). In a study of six patients with Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia who progressed after achieving major responses on ibrutinib, two patients harbored a C481R mutation, which was expressed in 32.4% and 0.3% of cells, respectively (PMID: 28235842)."
