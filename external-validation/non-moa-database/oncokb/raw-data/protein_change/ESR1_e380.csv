In a randomized, open-label Phase III EMERALD trial of elacestrant versus standard-of-care endocrine monotherapy in 477 patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had received one or two lines of endocrine therapy (n=228 patients with ESR1 missense mutations in codons 310-547), the ESR1-mutated cohort had a six-month progression free-survival (PFS) of 40.8% (95% CI=30.1, 51.4) versus 19.1% (95% CI=10.5, 27.8) and a twelve-month progression-free survival of 26.8% (95% CI=16.2, 37.4) versus 8.2% (95% CI=1.3, 15.1) for the elacestrant versus standard-of-care arm, respectively (PMID: 35584336). In the updated results from the Phase III EMERALD trial based on the duration of prior CDK4/6i treatment, the ESR1-mutated cohort previously treated with CDK4/6i for ≥6.0 months (n=103 elacestrant arm; n=102 stand-of-care arm), ≥12.0 months (n=78 elacestrant arm; n=81 stand-of-care arm) or ≥18.0 months (n=55 elacestrant arm; n=56 stand-of-care arm) demonstrated a median PFS of 4.1 months, 8.6 months and 8.6 months with elacestrant versus 1.9 months (HR=0.52 [95% CI=0.36, 0.74]), 1.9 months (HR=0.41 [95% CI=0.26, 0.63]) and 2.1 months (HR=0.47 [95% CI=0.20, 0.79]) with standard-of-care treatment (Abstract: Bardia et al.

In a retrospective analysis of the Phase III SoFEA trial of fulvestrant or exemestane in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, patients who had ER mutations had a significantly longer median progression-free survival when treated with fulvestrant (5.7 months) versus exemestane (2.6 months) (HR, 0.52; P = 0.02), while patients without ER mutations had no significant difference in median progression-free survival between the two treatment arms (P = 0.77) (PMID: 27269946). The addition of abemaciclib to fulvrestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer further increased overall survival in these patients (PMID: 31563959). In the randomized, open-label Phase III PADA-1 trial of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib in 172 patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with rising ESR1 mutation in blood, median progression-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI= 9.1-13.6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib experimental group versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.9-7.5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib control group (PMID: 36183733)."
