The NCCN lists PDGFRA D842V as a mutation that has known insensitivity to imatinib. In vitro studies in hematopoietic and epithelial cells engineered to express the PDGFRA D842V alteration were resistant to imatinib treatment, as evidenced by signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis assays (PMID: 15928335, 12949711, 22718859, 18794084, 22745105, 15685537, 18955458, 25905001, 23752188). Mouse models and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patient samples with the PDGFRA D842V mutation demonstrated resistance to imatinib therapy (PMID: 17087936, 18794084). In an international survey among GIST referral centers, 31 of 58 patients with PDGFRA alterations had the PDGFRA D842V mutation and none of the 31 patients achieved a clinical response to imatinib (PMID: 22718859). Additional studies have demonstrated that GIST patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation are resistant to imatinib therapy (PMID: 18955458, 25905001). In a study of 26 GIST patients, one individual treated with imatinib developed secondary resistance and no longer responded to imatinib therapy (PMID: 15685537). In a randomized phase II clinical study of imatinib therapy in advanced GIST, two of 48 patients with imatinib-resistant primary disease had a PDGFRA D842V alteration. Patients with the PDGFRA D842V alteration should consider alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies."
