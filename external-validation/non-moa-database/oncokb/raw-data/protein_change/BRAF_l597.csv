In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with plixorafenib and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. Preclinical studies show that plixorafenib specifically inhibits BRAF-containing dimers and inhibits proliferation and pathway activation in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines (PMID: 26466569, 28659148, 30559419, 28783719)."
