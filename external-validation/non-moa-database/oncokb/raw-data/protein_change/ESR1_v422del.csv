The Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines v4.2023 lists elacestrant for patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation. In a randomized, open-label Phase III EMERALD trial of elacestrant versus standard-of-care endocrine monotherapy in 477 ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who one to two lines of endocrine therapy (n=228 patients with ESR1 missense mutations in codons 310-547), the ESR1-mutated cohort had a six-month progression free-survival of 40.8% (95% CI, 30.1 to 51.4) versus 19.1% (95% CI, 10.5 to 27.8) and a twelve-month progression-free survival of 26.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 37.4) versus 8.2% (95% CI, 1.3 to 15.1) for the elacestrant versus standard-of-care arm, respectively (PMID: 35584336). In a Phase I study of elacestrant in 50 adult women with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (n=25 patients with baseline ESR1 mutations, including indel mutation L536_Y537del), the ESR1-mutated cohort had an objective response rate of 33.3% (n=5/15), a clinical benefit response of 56.5% (n=13/23) and a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 13.0) (PMID: 33513026)."

In a retrospective analysis of the Phase III SoFEA trial of fulvestrant or exemestane in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, patients who had ER mutations had a significantly longer median progression-free survival when treated with fulvestrant (5.7 months) versus exemestane (2.6 months) (HR, 0.52; P = 0.02), while patients without ER mutations had no significant difference in median progression-free survival between the two treatment arms (P = 0.77) (PMID: 27269946). The addition of abemaciclib to fulvrestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer further increased overall survival in these patients (PMID: 31563959). In the randomized, open-label Phase III PADA-1 trial of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib in 172 patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with rising ESR1 mutation in blood, median progression-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI= 9.1-13.6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib experimental group versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.9-7.5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib control group (PMID: 36183733)."
