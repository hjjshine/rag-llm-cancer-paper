There are promising clinical data in patients with ROS1 L2086F mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with cabozantinib. Across multiple case studies, patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC expressing ROS1 L2086F were treated with cabozantinib and achieved responses ranging from partial response (PR) (n=2) (PMID: 39117775, 39091594) to stable disease (n=2) (PMID: 33685866, 37291202). For the 2 PR, one patient was previously treated with entrectinib and one patient was previously treated with repotrectinib, at which time the ROS1 L2086F mutation was detected and cabozantinib treatment was started (PMID: 39117775, 39091594). In vitro studies with ROS1 fusion-positive patient-derived cells expressing ROS1 L2086F demonstrate sensitivity to cabozantinib as measured by inhibition of cellular proliferation and ROS1 autophosphorylation (PMID: 33685866, 39117775, 39091594)."

ROS1 L2086F has been identified as an acquired resistance mutation in patients with ROS1-mutant NSCLC upon disease progression with lorlatinib treatment. In multiple clinical studies, ROS1 L2086F was identified in four patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC following lorlatinib treatment (PMID: 37291202, 33685866). In vitro studies with ROS1 fusion-positive Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 L2086F demonstrate resistance to lorlatinib as measured by the IC50 values for lorlatinib increasing by a factor of over 4286 for ROS1 L2086F compared to wildtype ROS1 (PMID: 33685866)."
