The NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Guidelines (V5.2024) lists lorlatinib for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with ALK G1202R or ALK L1196M, excluding tumors harboring both ALK G1202R and L1196M as compound mutations. In the Phase II study of lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC harboring ALK resistance mutations, patients harboring ALK L1196M (n=12) demonstrated an overall response rate of 67% (95% CI=35-90), a median duration of response that was not reached (95% CI=5.2-NR) and a median progression-free survival that was not reached (95% CI=2.8-NR) (PMID: 30892989)."

In nine patients with ALK L1196M-positive non-small cell lung cancer, seven patients progressed on crizotinib, two patients progressed on ceritinib, and one patient progressed on alectinib (PMID: 23344087, 22277784, 22235099, 23434628, 28434515, 24675041, 27432227). The ALK L1196M mutation was detected in post-progression samples from patients with lung cancer that developed resistance to crizotinib after at least one prior line of therapy. No EGFR and KRAS alterations were detected upon progression and patients were on the drug for at least four months (PMID: 23344087, 22277784, 22235099, 23434628, 28434515). Expression of the ALK L1196M mutant in cell lines harboring the EML4-ALK fusion demonstrated decreased sensitivity to crizotinib as compared to control cells harboring only the EML4-ALK fusion (PMID: 23344087)."
