In a study of a single CLL patient who progressed on ibrutinib, mutational analysis identified a T316A mutation located in the SH2 domain of BTK, which was confirmed to confer resistance to ibrutinib in subsequent functional studies, including cell growth and phospho-flow assays in TMD8 cells transfected with T316A compared to wildtype (PMID: 27626698). In a study of nine CLL patients with ibrutinib-relapsed disease, one patient harbored a T316A mutation, which was determined to be in the major clone with a cancer cell fraction of 100% (PMID: 29296715)."
