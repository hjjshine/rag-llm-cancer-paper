There are promising clinical data in patients with ROS1 G2032R mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with taletrectinib. In the Phase II TRUST-I (NCT04395677) trial of taletrectinib in 173 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC, patients with ROS1 G2023R mutant NSCLC (n=12) demonstrated an objective response rate of 66.7% (95% CI=34.89-90.08) (PMID: 38822758). In vivo studies with ROS1 fusion-positive xenograft models expressing ROS1 G2023R demonstrate sensitivity to taletrectinib as measured by tumor regression and inhibition of ROS1 autophosphorylation (PMID: 31399568)."

ROS1-rearrangement for treatment with crizotinib were detected by the Oncomine Dx Target Test. ROS1 G2032R has been identified as an acquired resistance mutation in patients with ROS1-mutant NSCLC upon disease progression with crizotinib treatment. In multiple clinical studies, ROS1 G2032R was identified in 22 patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC following crizotinib treatment (PMID: 33685866, 29333528, 23724914). In vitro studies with ROS1 fusion-positive Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 G2032R demonstrate resistance to crizotinib as measured by sustained kinase activity (PMID: 32918045). In vitro enzymatic assays demonstrate that the crizotinib concentration needed to achieve 50% enzyme inhibition was increased by a factor of 270 for ROS1 G2032R compared to wildtype ROS1 (PMID: 23724914)."

ROS1 G2032R has been identified as an acquired resistance mutation in patients with ROS1-mutant NSCLC upon disease progression with lorlatinib treatment. In multiple clinical studies, ROS1 G2032R was identified in ten patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC following lorlatinib treatment (PMID: 36135089, 33685866). In vitro studies with ROS1 fusion-positive Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 G2032R demonstrate moderate resistance to lorlatinib as measured by the IC50 values for lorlatinib increasing by a factor of 281 for ROS1 G2032R compared to wildtype ROS1 (PMID: 33685866)."
