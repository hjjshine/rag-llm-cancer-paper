NTRK3 G623R is listed in the FDA label for larotrectinib as a resistance mutation. In one study, after an initial response to larotrectinib, two patients with solid tumors harboring an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion relapsed, with post-relapse sequencing identifying an NTRK3 G623R mutation in the post-treatment sample (PMID: 29466156). In another study, one patient with NTRK-fusion-positive cancer relapsed after 8 months of treatment with larotrectinib, and the NTRK3 G623R mutation was again identified in the post-treatment sample (PMID: 28578312)(PMID: 33328556)(PMID: 30093503)"

There are promising clinical data in patients with NTRK3 G623R-mutant solid tumors treated with selitrectinib. Case studies of patients with ETV6-NTRK3-rearranged solid tumors (n=1, infantile fibrosarcoma; n=1, mammary analog secretory carcinomas of the salivary glands; n=1, metastatic mixed acinar neuroendocrine carcinoma of pancreatic origin) expressing acquired NTRK3 G623R treated with selitrectinib demonstrated two partial responses (n=1, infantile fibrosarcoma; n=1, metastatic mixed acinar neuroendocrine carcinoma of pancreatic origin) and one patient expressed rapid symptomatic improvement and radiographic response (n=1, mammary analog secretory carcinomas of the salivary glands) (PMID: 28578312, 34030125, 37262390). Preclinical studies of xenograft mouse models and cell lines expressing NTRK3 G623R demonstrate sensitivity to selitrectinib as measured by tumor growth inhibition upon drug treatment (PMID: 28578312)."
