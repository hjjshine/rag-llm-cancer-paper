There are promising clinical data in patients with ALK F1174L-mutated neuroblastoma treated with lorlatinib. Preclinical studies with neuroblastoma cell lines and neuroblastoma patient-derived and cell-derived xenograft models harboring ALK F1174L demonstrate sensitivity to lorlatinib as measured by loss of ALK kinase activity and complete and sustained tumor regression (PMID: 27483357, 26554404). In the Phase I New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) Consortium (NANT2015-02) trial of lorlatinib in pediatric, adolescent and adult patients with ALK-driven refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma, cohort A1 (≥12 months old to <18 years old; n=25) and cohort A2 (≥18 years old; n=15) were treated with lorlatinib monotherapy and cohort B2 (≥12 months old to <18 years old; n=9) were treated with combination lorlatinib plus chemotherapy (PMID: 37012551). Among patients harboring ALK F1174L, cohort A1 (n=8, ALK F1174L) achieved one partial response (PR) and two stable disease (SD) responses, cohort A2 (n=7, ALK F1174L) achieved two complete responses (CR), three minor responses (MR) and two SD responses and cohort B2 (n=5, ALK F1174L) achieved one CR and two PRs (PMID: 37012551)."
