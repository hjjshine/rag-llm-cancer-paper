Description: Dabrafenib is an orally bioavailable RAF inhibitor that is FDA-approved for use in patients with BRAF V600E- and V600K-mutant metastatic melanoma. FDA approval is based on the randomized Phase III trial in which dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) was compared with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks) in 250 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic melanoma. Dabrafenib was associated with improved progression-free survival (median 5.1 months vs. 2.7 months with dacarbazine; hazard ratio = 0.30, p<0.0001) (PMID: 22735384). Dabrafenib may also be effective against brain metastases, as demonstrated by a Phase II trial in which approximately 40% of previously untreated and 30% of previously treated patients experienced an overall intracranial response and a separate trial in which nine out of ten patients had a reduction in the size of their brain metastases (PMID: 23051966, 22608338).

Description: Dabrafenib, an orally bioavailable RAF inhibitor, and trametinib, an orally bioavailable MEK1/2 inhibitor, are FDA-approved alone or in combination for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).

FDA approval was based on the Phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm PHAROS study of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in treatment-naïve (n=59) and previously treated (n=39) patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC (PMID: 37270692). In the Phase II PHAROS study, the objective response rate and duration of response for treatment-naïve patients were 72% (95% CI=62, 85) and 44 months (95% CI=23.1, NE), with 15% experiencing a complete response and 59% experiencing a partial response, compared to 46% (95% CI=30, 63) and 18 months (95% CI=7.4, NE) in previously treated patients, with 10% experiencing a complete response and 36% experiencing a partial response (PMID: 37270692).

"Approved indication: Trametinib is FDA-approved for BRAF V600E or V600K mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma
Approval level: LEVEL_1
Database: OncoKB
Description: Trametinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2 that is FDA-approved alone or with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).

Approval level: LEVEL_1
Database: OncoKB
Description: Vemurafenib is an orally available kinse inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF that is FDA-approved for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib has been shown to have nearly equivalent activity against melanomas with BRAF V600E and V600K mutations (PMID: 24508103). In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848). However, a trial evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with either combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to those treated with vemurafenib monotherapy demonstrated improved survival outcomes in the combination-therapy group compared to the vemurafenib group (PMID: 25399551).

Approval level: LEVEL_1
Database: OncoKB
Description: The RAF inhibitor vemurafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. FDA approval was based on results from the randomized Phase III coBRIM trial of combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and placebo in 495 patients with metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma that demonstrated superior clinical benefit measures in the combination versus the control arm. Specifically, median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination arm versus 6.2 months in the control arm (HR = 0.51), with a complete response rate of 10% versus 4%, respectively, and interim nine-month overall survival of 81% versus 73%, respectively (PMID: 25265494). Follow-up analysis of the coBRIM trial showed two-year overall survival was 48.3% in the combination group versus 38.0% in the monotherapy group (PMID: 27480103), and five-year followup of the BRIM7 study showed a median overall survival of 31.8 months and a five-year survival rate of 39.2% (PMID: 31732523).

Description: Erlotinib, a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is approved with or without ramucirumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. Results of the Phase III EURTAC trial demonstrated that patients with NSCLC receiving erlotinib showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (9.7 vs. 5.2 months; HR=0.37; p=0.0001) compared to those receiving platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (PMID: 22285168). The partial response rate with erlotinib was 56%, compared to 13% with chemotherapy, and was associated with a reduced toxicity profile (PMID: 22285168). The safety and efficacy of erlotinib have not been established in patients harboring EGFR mutations other than exon 19 deletion and exon 21 (L858R) substitution; however, the phase III IUNO trial demonstrated no difference in PFS between patients with NSCLC lacking EGFR exon 19 deletion or EGFR L858R mutation who were given erlotinib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (PMID: 27987585).

Description: Gefitinib, a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is FDA-approved as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. FDA approval is based on multiple clinical trials that demonstrated the efficacy of gefitinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and includes IPASS (PMID: 19692680, 21670455), NEJ002 (PMID: 20573926), WJTOG3405 (PMID: 20022809) and First-SIGNAL (PMID: 22370314). Response rates in EGFR-mutant lung cancers in these studies ranged from 55% to 85%, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8 to 10.8 months (PMID: 19692680, 21670455, 20573926, 20022809, 22370314). In one study comparing gefitinib with standard chemotherapy in pulmonary adenocarcinoma, the response rate with gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutations (47%) was nearly double that of patients who were EGFR wildtype (24%) (PMID: 19692680). Additionally, in the biomarker analysis and final overall survival (OS) analysis of the Phase III IPASS study, though OS was not different between the gefitinib and carboplatin/paclitaxel groups, 64.3% of patients assigned to chemotherapy had crossed over to treatment with EGFR TKIs; PFS in this study was significantly longer with gefitinib than chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation (HR=0.48) (PMID: 21670455). In a Phase II trial, the addition of carboplatin plus pemetrexed to gefitinib increased progression-free survival (20.9 months vs 11.9 months; HR = 0.490, P < .001) in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC compared to gefitinib alone (PMID: 31682542).

EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations for treatment with osimertinib were detected by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne Liquid CDx or Guardant360 CDx. FDA approvals were based on the results of the Phase III ADAURA (NCT02511106) trial for adjuvant treatment, the Phase III LAURA (NCT03521154) trial for locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC treatment and the Phase III FLAURA (NCT02296125) trial for first-line monotherapy treatment. 

In the Phase III ADAURA (NCT02511106) trial of osimertinib versus placebo in 682 patients with completely resected EGFR mutation-positive stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, 89% (95% CI=85-92) of patients in the osimertinib cohort (n=339 [55%, EGFR exon 19 deletion; 45%, EGFR L858R; 1%, EGFR T790M]) and 52% (95% CI=46-58) of patients in the placebo cohort (n=343 [55%, EGFR exon 19 deletion; 45%, EGFR L858R; 1%, EGFR T790M]) were alive and disease-free at 24 months (HR=0.20 [99.12% CI=0.14-0.30]; p<0.001) (PMID: 32955177). 

In the Phase III LAURA (NCT03521154) trial of osimertinib versus placebo in 216 patients with unresectable EGFR mutation-positive stage III NSCLC without progression during or after chemoradiotherapy, the osimertinib cohort (n=143 [n=74, EGFR exon 19 deletion; n=68, EGFR L858R]) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 57% (95% CI=49-66), with a 2% (n=3) complete response (CR) rate, 55% (n=79) partial response (PR) rate and 31% (n=45) stable disease (SD) rate, a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 39.1 months (95% CI=31.5-NC) and a median duration of response (DOR) of 36.9 months (95% CI=30.1-NC).

Description: Erlotinib and gefitinib are first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while afatinib is a second-generation EGFR TKI; these inhibitors are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. Several case reports have documented the response of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR S768I mutation as either a single or compound mutation to erlotinib and gefitinib (PMID: 17285735, 25521405). One patient with EGFR S768I-positive NSCLC had a durable partial response to erlotinib for eight years before acquiring a T790M mutation and subsequently progressing (PMID: 25521405). Further, in an analysis of 860 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were prospectively tested for actionable mutations, four of four patients (100%) with an EGFR S768I mutation in conjunction with an EGFR G719 substitution mutation who received EGFR TKI therapy had clinical benefit (PMID: 28336552). Additionally, in the Phase II and Phase III LUX-lung 2, -3, and -6 trials, afatinib treatment resulted in objective responses in eight of eight patients (100%) with NSCLC harboring the EGFR S768I mutation, leading to the FDA approval of afatinib for EGFR S768I-mutated NSCLC (PMID: 26051236).

FDA approval was based on the results from a Phase I dose escalation and expansion study of ivosidenib in IDH1-mutant AML in which 27 and eleven of 125 patients who received ivosidenib achieved complete remission and complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, respectfully, yielding a complete response rate of 30.4% (PMID: 29860938). In the multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III AGILE study of combination treatment of ivosidenib and azacitidine in 146 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated IDH1-mutant AML (ivosidenib plus azacitidine treatment, n=72; placebo and azacitidine treatment, n=72), 46.2% maintained red blood cell transfusion independence in the ivosidenib plus azacitidine group and 17.5% in the placebo plus azacitidine group (Abstract: Dohner et al. Abstract# 7042, ASCO 2022. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.7042). In a real-world retrospective study of ivosidenib plus hypomethylating agent versus venetoclax plus hypomethylating agent in 283 patients with IDH1-mutant AML, the ivosidenib cohort (n=182) demonstrated a complete response of 42.9% and a median time to best response of 3.3 months versus 26.7% (p=0.007) and 4.1 months (p=0.02), respectively, in the venetoclax cohort (n=101) (Abstract: Smith et al.

FDA approval is based on data from the Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SOLAR-1 trial of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 patients with breast cancer in which the progression-free survival in patients with PIK3CA mutation (n=341) was eleven months (95% CI= 7.5-14.5) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.7-7.4) with placebo plus fulvestrant (HR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.5-0.85; p= 0.0013) compared to PIK3CA-wildtype patients in which the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.58-1.25) (PMID: 31091374). Overall response in the PIK3CA-mutant population was 35.7 months (95% CI= 27.4-44.7; n=126) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 16.2 months (95% CI= 10.4-23.5; n=136) with placebo plus fulvestrant (PMID: 31091374). Previous studies, including in vivo xenograft studies and a phase I trial, also demonstrated that treatment of ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer with the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib results in greater tumor shrinkage than either drug alone, with fulvestrant inhibiting the induction of ER-dependent gene transcription resulting from PI3Kα inhibition with alpelisib (PMID: 25877889, 30543347).

In cell proliferation assays, dasatinib was more effective than imatinib in inhibiting the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL mutants, including E255V, F359V, Y253H, and E255K, and biochemical assays showed that dasatinib inhibited ABL-catalyzed peptide substrate phosphorylation with approximately 325-fold higher potency than imatinib (PMID: 15930265). In a meta-analysis of three separate dasatinib trials in CP CML, of 402 patients with a BCR-ABL mutation, 362 patients (90%) had a complete hematologic response, 225 (56%) had a major cytogenetic response, and 175 (44%) had a complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19779040).

Description: Erlotinib, a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is FDA-approved for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations receiving first-line, maintenance, or second-or-greater line treatment after progression following at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In vitro characterization of A763_Y764insFQEA demonstrated that it had an IC50 of < 0.05µM to erlotinib, which is more than ten-fold lower than the clinically achievable serum concentrations of this drug, and submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR in A763_Y764insFQEA mutant Ba/F3 cells, leading to deactivation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways and subsequently inducing apoptosis (PMID: 24353160). In a study of 33 patients with NSCLC with exon 20 insertions, one patient harbored an A763_Y764insFQEA mutation and was treated with erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy and had a partial response (PMID: 23371856). In a case study of a single adult patient with NSCLC harboring an A763_Y764insFQEA mutation who was treated with erlotinib following disease progression after treatment with chemotherapy, the patient achieved a partial response at the two-month CT imaging assessment and at five months showed stable disease (PMID: 23969006). In a retrospective study of six patients harboring the EGFR exon 20 insertion A763_Y764insFQEA, two were treated with erlotinib, resulting in a partial response in one patient and progressive disease in the other, with progression-free survival rates of 14.5 and three months, respectively (PMID: 28089594).

Description: Sotorasib is an orally available, small molecule KRAS G12C inhibitor that is FDA-approved for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The NCCN Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma Guidelines (V1.2025) lists sotorasib monotherapy under ""Second-Line and Subsequent Therapy"" for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant small bowel adenocarcinoma. NCCN recommendation is based on the results of the Phase II CodeBreaK 100 (NCT03600883) trial of sotorasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant colorectal cancer. Due to the infrequency of KRAS G12C-mutant small bowel cancers, this recommendation relies on evidence extrapolated from colorectal cancer patients.

In the Phase II CodeBreaK 100 (NCT03600883) trial arm of sotorasib monotherapy for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors, a patient with small bowel cancer demonstrated stable disease after treatment with sotorasib (PMID: 32955176).

NCCN recommendation is based on evidence showing activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC with MET amplification or exon 14 skipping mutations (PMID: 21623265). In a study of twelve evaluable patients with c-MET amplified NSCLC, four patients had partial responses (33%) with a median duration of response of 35 weeks (Abstract: Camidge et al. Abstract# 8001, ASCO 2014. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/132030-144). In another study of four patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, three patients who were treated with crizotinib had a partial response to therapy (PMID: 25971939). A retrospective analysis also identified a patient with lung cancer harboring amplification of a mutant MET allele who had a major partial response to crizotinib (PMID: 26729443). In a study of crizotinib in 26 patients with MET-altered NSCLC, the objective response rate was 27%, median progression-free survival at the time of cutoff was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.0-5.8), and overall survival was 5.4 months (95% CI= 4.2-6.5) (PMID: 31416808). In a study of crizotinib in patients with MET exon 14-altered NSCLC, the overall response rate in the 65 tumor-evaluable patients was 32% (95% CI= 21-45) with three patients (5%) achieving a confirmed complete response, eighteen (28%) achieving a confirmed partial response and 29 (45%) achieving stable disease (PMID: 31932802).

Nivolumab is also recommended in the Colon Cancer NCCN Guidelines (v3.2024) as a treatment option for patients with dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutant, proofreading deficient (pd) advanced or metastatic colon cancer (mCRC). In a retrospective, multinational study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, patients with POLE/D1 pd tumors (n=27) had significantly improved outcomes compared to patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (n=610), with overall response rates (ORRs) of 89% versus 54%, progression-free survival (PFS) rates at two years of 88% versus 60%, and overall survival (OS) rates at two years of 86% versus 72% respectively (PMID: 38777726). In a pan-cancer study of patients with MSI-stable/low tumors treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PDL-1 inhibitors, patients with functional POLE/D1 mutations (n=24) had a clinical benefit rate of 75% versus 30% for patients with POLE/D1 wildtype tumors (n=1038) (PMID: 35817971). The NCCN recommendation is based on results from the multicenter, open-label Phase II CheckMate-142 (NCT02060188) trial of nivolumab in 74 patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC. In this study at the median follow-up, 51 patients had disease control, 23 patients achieved an objective partial response (31.1%; 95% CI=20.8–42.9) and only three of 23 responders went on to have progressive disease (PMID: 28734759).

Description: Pembrolizumab, a human anti-PD1 antibody and immune checkpoint inhibitor, is FDA-approved for patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). Pembrolizumab is also recommended in the Colon Cancer NCCN Guidelines (v2.2024) as a treatment option for dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutant, proofreading deficient (pd) metastatic colon cancer. In a retrospective, multinational study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with anti-PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, patients with POLE/D1 pd tumors (n=27) had significantly improved outcomes compared to patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (n=610), with overall response rates (ORRs) of 89% versus 54%, progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 2 years of 88% versus 60%, and overall survival (OS) rates at 2 years of 86% versus 72% respectively (PMID: 38777726). In a pan-cancer study of patients with MSI-stable/low tumors treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PDL-1 inhibitors, patients with functional POLE/D1 mutations (n=24) had a clinical benefit rate of 75% versus 30% for patients with POLE/D1 wildtype tumors (n=1038) (PMID: 35817971). The NCCN recommendation is based on data in patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC (irrespective of POLE mutation status), which includes results from the Phase II J1365 (NCT01876511) trial of pembrolizumab in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without dMMR. In this trial the overall response rate (ORR) to pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer or MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal solid tumors was 40% (95% CI=12–74) and 71% (95% CI=29–96), respectively, while the ORR to pembrolizumab in patients with MMR-proficient colorectal cancer was 0% (PMID: 26028255). While median OS was not reached in patients with dMMR tumors, median PFS in patients with MMR-proficient tumors was 2.2 months (95% CI=1.4–2.8) and median OS was 5.0 months (95% CI=3.0–not estimable) (PMID: 26028255).

In a Phase I (NCT01226316) basket study of capivasertib in AKT E17K-mutated cancers, capivasertib treatment induced partial responses (PR) in two patients with endometrial cancer and one patient with cervical cancer, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.6 months (PMID: 28489509). In a second Phase I (NCT01353781) study of 41 patients with solid tumors in Japan, two patients with the AKT E17K mutation, one having breast cancer and the other having ovarian cancer, demonstrated PR to capivasertib (PMID: 26351323). In the Phase II NCI-MATCH subprotocol EAY131-Y (NCT04439123) trial of capivasertib in patients with AKT1 E17K-mutated metastatic tumors (n= 3, patients with ovarian cancer), one patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response and remained on therapy for >35.6 months (PMID: 33377972). 
In vitro studies of breast cancer explants harboring the AKT E17K mutation have shown that capivasertib inhibits tumor growth and reduces signaling downstream of AKT, including reduced phosphorylation of PRAS40 and S6 (PMID: 22294718).

Description: Poziotinib is a second-generation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR, HER2 and HER4. There is promising clinical data that supports the use of poziotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions.
Prior to launching an investigator-initiated trial of poziotinib in EGFR exon 20 mutated advanced NSCLC, a single patient with metastatic NSCLC that exhibited a HER2 A771insAYVM mutation (a HER2 exon 20 insertion that behaves like an EGFR exon 20 insertion) was treated with poziotinib and had a pronounced clinical and radiological response (PMID: 29686424). In a Phase II (NCT01718847) study of poziotinib in 39 patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who developed acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, three of 39 (8%; 95% CI=2-21) and seventeen of 39 (44%; 95% CI=28-60) patients had partial responses and stable disease, respectively, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival was 2.7 months (95% CI=1.8-3.7) and 15.0 months (95% CI=9.5-NE), respectively (PMID: 27188206). In a Phase II (NCT03066206) study of poziotinib in 50 patients with advanced NSCLC with point mutations or insertions in EGFR exon 20, overall response rates for patients overall, patients with near-loop mutations and patients with far-loop mutations were 32.0% (95% CI=20.7-45.8, n=16), 46% and 0%, respectively(PMID: 35820397). Additionally, the disease control rate was 84.0% (95% CI=71.5-92.0) and the median PFS and overall survival were 5.5 months (95% CI=5.4-10.4) and 19.2 months (95% CI=11.8-24.1) in these populations, respectively (PMID: 35820397). 
In vitro, poziotinib was shown to be approximately 40 times more potent than afatinib and 65 times more potent than dacomitinib at inhibiting growth in Ba/F3 cell lines bearing different EGFR exon 20 insertions (PMID: 29686424). In genetically engineered mouse models and xenograft models harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion, poziotinib resulted in 80% tumor reduction in four weeks and 50% tumor reduction in ten days, whereas afatinib did not reduce tumor burden in either model (PMID: 29686424).

Description: Zipalertinib is an orally available, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor with broad activity against EGFR exon 20 insertions. There is promising clinical data that supports the use of zipalertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions.
In the Phase I/IIa REZILIENT1 (NCT04036682) trial of zipalertinib in 70 evaluable patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, results reported that 25/70 patients (36%) had a partial response (PR) (seven unconfirmed, one pending confirmation), 34/70 patients (49%) had stable disease (SD) and 3/70 patients (4%) had progressive disease (PD) as best response (PMID: 37384848). In the subcohort results of the Phase IIb REZILIENT1 (NCT04036682) trial of zipalertinib in 45 patients with EGFR exon 20 mutant-NSCLC that progressed after prior amivantamab treatment, the overall response rate was 40%, with one patient (3%) demonstrating complete response, eleven patients (37%) demonstrating PR and fifteen patients (50%) demonstrating SD, the disease control rate was 90% and the median progression-free survival was 9.7 months (Abstract: Passaro et al. ESMO 2024. https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(24)02830-8/fulltext).

Description: Afatinib, a second-generation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and HER4, is NCCN-listed and FDA-approved for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have non-resistant EGFR mutations. In vitro studies of Ba/F3 cells transfected with E709_T710delinsD, a rare mutation in exon 18 of EGFR, demonstrated sensitivity to afatinib with an IC50 of 1.7 nmol/L, a finding that was further supported in the clinic when a single patient with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring E709_T710delinsD was treated with afatinib and experienced substantial tumor shrinkage (PMID: 26206867). In a separate single-patient study, another stage IV NSCLC patient with the E709_T710delinsD mutation was treated with and responded well to afatinib, resulting in progression-free survival of eleven months and overall survival that exceeded 21 months (PMID: 31686847). In a third single-patient study, a 56-year-old female patient with advanced NSCLC harboring the E709_T710delinsD mutation was treated with afatinib as a sixth-line treatment for seven months, during which time the size of her pulmonary lesion significantly reduced until her disease progressed and treatment was stopped (PMiD: 31187861). A fourth case report of a 52-year-old female with bilateral advanced NSCLC harboring the delE709_T710insD mutation demonstrated significant clinical and radiographic responses to treatment with afatinib (PMID: 28625646).

Description: Neratinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the ERBB2 and EGFR kinases that is FDA-approved for HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated with adjuvant trastuzumab and is a category 2B NCCN recommendation for patients with HER2-mutant breast cancer. In a Phase II basket trial of patients across multiple tumor types with ERBB2 activating mutations, the overall response rate at eight weeks in patients with HER2 non-amplified breast cancer (N=25) was 32% [95% CI= 15-54%]. ERBB2 mutations associated with a response in breast cancer included the HER2 hotspot extracellular domain mutation S310, HER2 kinase domain hotspot mutations, exon 20 insertions, and the non-hotspot complex insertion/substitution L755_E757delinsS. Responses were observed in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)+ (30%, 6/20) and ER- (40%, 2/5) tumors (PMID: 29420467).

Description: Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies against ERBB2/HER2 and docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. The triple combination of these therapeutic agents is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. In a multicenter, nonrandomized phase II study (FCT 1703-R2D2, NCT03845270) of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and docetaxel in 45 patients with ERBB2-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer who progressed after at least one platinum-based treatment, the objective response rate was 29% (n = 13/45) in which 58% of patients had stable disease (n = 26/45) and the median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI=4.0 to 8.5) (PMID: 35073148). Preclinical studies in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines and HER2-positive breast and non–small cell lung cancer xenograft models have shown that combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab resulted in greater antitumor activity compared to treatment with either antibody alone due to more comprehensive signaling blockade provided by the antibodies binding to different HER2 epitopes (PMID: 15059883, 19934333). In a separate preclinical study, treatment of a HER2-positive mouse xenograft model of breast cancer with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel resulted in enhanced apoptosis, infiltration of mononuclear cells, a strong reduction in the phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, HER3, ERK, and AKT, as well as a slower tumor growth rate compared to controls (PMID: 28959366).

Abstract# LBA_26, SGO 2024. https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(24)00453-0/fulltext). In vivo xenograft studies with TP53 Y220C-mutant gastric cancer cell line NUGC3 and Y220C-mutant patient-derived xenografts demonstrated sensitivity to rezatapopt treatment as measured by dose-dependent tumor shrinkage and conversion of TP53 Y220C to the wildtype conformation (Abstract: Dumble et al.

Description: Plixorafenib is an orally available, second-generation, small-molecule BRAF inhibitor that inhibits mutated, oncogenic BRAF without causing paradoxical MAPK pathway activation as is seen with first-generation BRAF inhibitors (PMID: 28659148). In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with plixorafenib and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. In a phase I/IIa trial of plixorafenib for patients with BRAF-altered, advanced solid or CNS tumors (n=110; n=61, patients with class 1 mutations; n=19, patients with class 2 mutations [excluding fusions]; n=17, patients with BRAF fusions), partial response was achieved in 39% (n=9/23) of patients with MAPKi-naive, V600-mutant tumors, with a median duration of response (DoR) of 32 months, and in 18% (n=3/17) of patients with MAPKi treated, V600-mutant tumors (n=6, patients with V600-mutant glioma; n=3, patients with V600-mutant ovarian cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant small bowel cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant papillary thyroid cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer) (Abstract: Fuente et al.

Expression of EGFR mutations, including A289V and T263P, in glioma cell lines demonstrated that they are sensitive to lapatinib as measured by increased apoptosis and decreased pathway activation upon drug treatment. Other EGFR alterations in lung and endometrial cells, including amplification or increased expression, have also demonstrated sensitivity to lapatinib treatment as measured by decreased proliferation and pathway activation (PMID: 22588883, 20459769, 18334972).

Description: Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits T790M-mutant EGFR. Clinical and in vitro studies have shown that the EGFR D716Y mutation confers resistance to first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib (PMID: 17085664). Expression of EGFR D761Y along with EGFR L858R in cell lines has demonstrated that this mutation retains sensitivity to osimertinib as measured by inhibited proliferation and attenuated pathway activation upon drug treatment (PMID: 28424065).

Description: Trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib are MEK1/2 kinase inhibitors that are NCCN-listed and FDA-approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. In a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase IB trial (NCT02964689) of binimetinib in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in fourteen evaluable patients with stage III-IV NSCLC with KRAS (codon 12, 13 or 61) mutations, the overall response rate was 33% (95% CI=7–70) among the nine patients that received binimetinib, where three of nine patients had a partial response, two of nine had stable disease, three of nine had progressive disease, and one of nine was not assessable for response (PMID: 33933896). On average, in vitro studies have shown that trametinib inhibits the proliferation of KRAS mutant cancer cell lines (n = 50) with lower IC50s than other MEK inhibitors, including selumetinib (PMID: 24746704). Cobimetinib, which inhibits the kinase activity of MEK but allows the induction of RAF-dependent feedback phosphorylation of MEK, was demonstrated to be less effective in KRAS-mutant tumors than in BRAF-mutant tumors (PMID: 25435214, 23934108).

Retrospective studies of mTOR inhibitors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma indicate that mutations in TSC1, TSC2, and mTOR are associated with response to treatment (PMID: 24622468, 26831717). Preclinical studies show that cancer cell lines with hyperactivating mTOR mutations are sensitive to mTOR inhibitor treatment as measured by decreased proliferation in cell line and xenograft experiments (PMID: 24631838, 27482884). However, one analysis of the RECORD-3 trial has indicated that PTEN status versus mTOR, TSC1 or TSC2 status may be the major correlative in response to treatment with everolimus (PMID: 30327302).

The NCCN considers the ABL1 T315I mutation as ""contraindicated"" for the therapies imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib in patients with BCR-ABL1 positive (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a study of 186 patients with Ph+ CML, mutational analysis was performed upon treatment failure and revealed that T315I was detected in 27 patients: twenty after imatinib failure, and in 7/23 patients who developed new mutations after a median of ten months on a second TKI (four dasatinib, one nilotinib, one bosutinib) (PMID: 18403620). In a multicenter retrospective study of 27 Ph+ CML patients treated with imatinib who developed a T315I mutation, patients had poor prognostic features, including a lack of complete cytogenetic response (59%), overall survival rates of 42.5 months for chronic and 17.5 months for advanced phase patients, and 100% of patients progressed (PMID: 17768119). In a study of twelve Ph+ CML patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy, 9/12 patients harbored the T315I mutation, which has been shown to disrupt a hydrogen bond that is critical for dasatinib binding and to create steric hindrance that interferes with the inhibitor entering the ATP-binding site (PMID: 17339191).

The NCCN considers the ABL1 T315I mutation as ""contraindicated"" for the therapies imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib in patients with BCR-ABL1 positive (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a study of 186 patients with Ph+ CML, mutational analysis was performed upon treatment failure and revealed that T315I was detected in 27 patients: twenty after imatinib failure, and in 7/23 patients who developed new mutations after a median of ten months on a second TKI (four dasatinib, one nilotinib, one bosutinib) (PMID: 18403620). In a multicenter retrospective study of 27 Ph+ CML patients treated with imatinib who developed a T315I mutation, patients had poor prognostic features, including a lack of complete cytogenetic response (59%), overall survival rates of 42.5 months for chronic and 17.5 months for advanced phase patients, and 100% of patients progressed (PMID: 17768119). In a study of twelve Ph+ CML patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy, 9/12 patients harbored the T315I mutation, which has been shown to disrupt a hydrogen bond that is critical for dasatinib binding and to create steric hindrance that interferes with the inhibitor entering the ATP-binding site (PMID: 17339191). In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays performed in Ba/F3 cells expressing one of eighteen different BCR-ABL mutations compared to BCR-ABL wild-type, T315I was resistant to all TKIs tested, including imatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib (PMID: 19075254).

Description: Dasatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases that is FDA-approved for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and is NCCN-listed. In a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial (#CA180015) of dasatinib in 36 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 34 patients) or -intolerant (n = 2 patients) Ph+ ALL, major hematologic responses were achieved in 42% (15/36) of patients and complete cytogenetic responses were achieved by 58% (21/36) of patients (PMID:17496201). In a randomized, open-label, international, phase III study of dasatinib in 84 patients with Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib, the rates of confirmed major hematologic response in the once-(n = 40) and twice-daily (n = 44) dosing groups were 38% and 32%, respectively, and the rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%) (PMID: 20131302). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (median, 3 months versus 4 months, respectively) (PMID: 20131302). In a study of nine Ph+ ALL patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy, BCR-ABL kinase sequences were analyzed before and during treatment and in all but one patient, resistance to dasatinib was found to be associated with mutations at residue 315 and/or at residue 317, including F317L (n = 3), F317I (n = 1), and T315A (n = 1) (PMID: 17339191).

Description: Dasatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases that is NCCN-listed and is FDA-approved for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 71 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with dasatinib as a second or third TKI, 31 patients relapsed on dasatinib with evidence of newly acquired resistance mutations, including F317L (n = 9/31), V299L (n = 4/31), T315A (n = 3/31), F317I (n = 2/31), F317C (n = 1/31), and F317V (n = 1/31), and one patient had evidence of multiple mutations (F317I + F317V + F317C) (PMID: 19589924). In a meta-analysis of three separate dasatinib trials in chronic phase CML, of 402 patients with a BCR-ABL mutation, patients with the F317L mutation had a high rate of complete hematologic response (13/14, 93%), but low rates of major (2/14, 14%) and complete (1/14, 7%) cytogenetic responses (PMID: 19779040). In a study of seventeen patients with Ph+ CML who developed resistance to dasatinib following imatinib, all patients had new BCR-ABL mutations at the time of relapse on dasatinib that were not detected at the time of relapse on imatinib, including V299L (n = 4/17), T315A ( n = 1/17), F317L (n = 1/17), and F317I (n = 1/17) (PMID: 17710227).

In a phase I dose-escalation study (NCT00109707) of nilotinib in thirteen patients with Ph+ ALL, one patient had a partial hematologic response and another had a complete molecular remission (PMID: 16775235). In a study of 54 patients with persistent CML who received nilotinib after imatinib failure as a second- or third-line treatment, the most frequent mutations found in patients with nilotinib failure were located in the P-loop, particularly Y253F/H, E255K, and G250E, as well as F359C/V (PMID: 17785585). In a retrospective analysis of treatment-emergent mutations and their impact on response in 563 patients with CP Ph+ CML who were treated with nilotinib as part of the ENESTnd phase III trial, multiple alterations were identified including G250E (n = 1), Y253H (n= 8), E255K (n = 4), E255V (n = 1), and F359V (n = 6), which resulted in suboptimal responses or treatment failure in most patients (PMID: 23502220). In a subanalysis of an open-label, phase II study of nilotinib in 281 evaluable patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP Ph+ CML, patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, where 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved major cytogenetic response and none achieved complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19652056). In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 50 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with nilotinib as a second or third TKI, fourteen patients relapsed with evidence of newly acquired mutations including Y253H (n = 4/14), E255V (n = 3/14), E255K (n = 2/14), and F359V (n = 1/14), and three patients already harboring mutations (Y253H, n = 2/3; E255K + F317L, n = 1/3) did not achieve any response to nilotinib as second (Y253H) or third TKI (E255K + F317L) (PMID: 19589924).

Whole-exome sequencing performed at baseline and time of relapse on samples from six CLL patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy revealed a C481S mutation in five of six patients, and subsequent functional analyses have shown that ibrutinib is significantly less effective at inhibiting cell growth and blocking BTK autophosphorylation and downstream signaling (as indicated by pERK levels) in cells with C481S compared to wildtype (WT) BTK (PMID: 24869598, 27282255, 27626698). In a study of 308 patients with CLL who enrolled in four sequential clinical trials of ibrutinib, eight patients relapsed, all of whom harbored a C491S mutation with an expansion of the clone before relapse (PMID: 28418267). In a phase II study (NCT01500733) of 86 patients treated with single-agent ibrutinib, fifteen patients progressed, of whom seven had a C481S mutation (PMID: 28049639).

Description: Imatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of KIT, PDGFRA and other kinases, is FDA-approved for adult patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The NCCN lists PDGFRA D842V as a mutation that has known insensitivity to imatinib. In vitro studies in hematopoietic and epithelial cells engineered to express the PDGFRA D842V alteration were resistant to imatinib treatment, as evidenced by signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis assays (PMID: 15928335, 12949711, 22718859, 18794084, 22745105, 15685537, 18955458, 25905001, 23752188). Mouse models and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patient samples with the PDGFRA D842V mutation demonstrated resistance to imatinib therapy (PMID: 17087936, 18794084). In an international survey among GIST referral centers, 31 of 58 patients with PDGFRA alterations had the PDGFRA D842V mutation and none of the 31 patients achieved a clinical response to imatinib (PMID: 22718859). Additional studies have demonstrated that GIST patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation are resistant to imatinib therapy (PMID: 18955458, 25905001). In a study of 26 GIST patients, one individual treated with imatinib developed secondary resistance and no longer responded to imatinib therapy (PMID: 15685537). In a randomized phase II clinical study of imatinib therapy in advanced GIST, two of 48 patients with imatinib-resistant primary disease had a PDGFRA D842V alteration. Patients with the PDGFRA D842V alteration should consider alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

In several case reports, patients with this mutation progressed on crizotinib. In a clinical study of 13 patients with EML4-ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that relapsed on crizotinib therapy (duration of crizotinib therapy averaged ten to eleven months before relapse), one patient acquired an EML4-ALK C1156Y alteration at relapse (PMID: 23434628). In a second case study, a patient with EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC had a partial response to crizotinib therapy for five months before relapse due to the C1156Y alteration (PMID: 20979473). Another patient with NSCLC achieved a clinical response to crizotinib for 18 months before relapse due to the acquisition of the C1156Y alteration (PMID: 26698910). Similarly, a patient with EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC responded to crizotinib for 7 months before developing an ALK C1156Y mutation and progressing (PMID: 27045755).

Description: Cetuximab and panitumumab are anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies that are FDA-approved for patients with EGFR-expressing, RAS-wildtype colorectal cancer. In a ctDNA study of patients with colorectal cancer who progressed on cetuximab or panitumumab, the EGFR V441D mutation was identified in 16 patients either as one of many EGFR-pathway mutations (n=13) or as a single EGFR-pathway mutation (n=3) that could explain progression on cetuximab or panitumumab (PMID: 29423521, 29196463). Preclinical studies with NIH3T3 cells expressing EGFR V441D demonstrated resistance to both cetuximab and panitumumab as measured by reduced binding and increased phosphorylated EGFR levels following treatment compared to wildtype (PMID: 29423521, 29196463).

Description: Osimertinib is an orally available, small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR T790M that is FDA-approved for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations and for adult patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy, as detected by an FDA-approved test. EGFR mutational status was identified through the cobas EGFR Mutation Test. The EGFR L718Q mutation has been identified in eight patients with NSCLC following disease progression on osimertinib, with seven patients harboring either EGFR L858R and T790M or EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M and one patient harboring only EGFR L858R (PMID: 27257132, 29506987, 33937055, 31205925, 31315676, 34926262, 31315676, 32146032). Preclinical studies with cells expressing EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion, T790M and L718Q demonstrate resistance to osimertinib as measured by IC50 values comparable to cells expressing the control EGFR C797S (PMID: 29506987).

EGFR mutational status was identified through the cobas EGFR Mutation Test. The EGFR G742S mutation has been identified as an acquired resistance mutation to osimertinib, including in two cases of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, in two additional patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion-mutant NSCLC and in five additional patients with EGFR G724S-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, with loss of the T790M allele accompanying progression in these patients (PMID: 28838405, 30228210, 35979997, 30405134). Preclinical studies with cells expressing EGFR G724S demonstrate resistance to osimertinib in vitro and in vivo (PMID: 30405134). Expression in combination with either an EGFR exon 19 deletion or the EGFR L858R mutation in HEK293 cells demonstrated that the G724S mutation significantly reduced osimertinib affinity for the EGFR exon 19 deletion while not affecting the ability of osimertinib to bind to or inhibit the EGFR L858R mutation (PMID: 30796031).

In vitro data shows that L858R+L718V is less sensitive to osimertinib, gefitinib, and erlotinib compared to L858R alone. In silico data suggests that EGFR L718V may alter the structure of EGFR to occlude osimertinib binding (PMID: 29571986, 31301016, 31757379, 29568384).

Description: Lorlatinib is a third-generation small molecule inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on one or more ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase II trial of lorlatinib in 215 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in which the overall response rate was 48% and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. In patients with measurable brain metastases (n=89), the intracranial response rate was 60%, with a median duration of response of 19.5 months (PMID: 30413378). Responses were seen across various ALK mutations (PMID: 30413378), but most notably in G1202R-mutant tumors, which are resistant to first-generation ALK inhibitors (PMID: 27432227). In the Phase I trial of lorlatinib in patients with NSCLC with ALK or ROS rearrangements, four patients who harbored ALK G1202R mutation in addition to their ALK rearrangements had a clinical response to lorlatinib treatment (PMID: 29074098). In a Phase II clinical trial of lorlatinib in 198 patients with NSCLC, among patients who failed one or more second-generation ALK TKIs, lorlatinib showed greater efficacy in patients with ALK mutations compared to patients without ALK mutations (69% versus 27%), with progression-free survival for patients with ALK mutations significantly longer than for patients without ALK mutations (11 months vs 5.4 months, hazard ratio = 0.47) (PMID: 30892989). In the randomized, controlled Phase III CROWN trial evaluating lorlatinib versus crizotinib in previously untreated patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC with or without brain metastases (n=296), median progression-free survival in the lorlatinib arm (n=149) was not reached (95% CI = not reached-not reached) versus 9.3 months (95% CI = 7.6-11.1; p < .0001) with an objective response rate of 76% (95% CI = 68-83) versus 58% (95% CI = 7.6-11.1), respectively (PMID: 33207094). In the post-hoc analysis of the Phase III CROWN trial, median progression-free survival among patients without baseline brain metastases was not reached (95% CI = not reached–not reached) in the lorlatinib group (n=111) versus eleven months (95% CI = 9.0-14.6 months; HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.20–0.49; p < .0001) in the crizotinib group (n=107), and the median progression-free survival among patients with baseline brain metastases was not reached (95% CI = 18.2 months–not reached) in the lorlatinib group (n=38) versus 7.2 months (95% CI = 3.7–9.2 months) in the crizotinib group (n=40) (PMID: 35605188).

Description: Entrectinib is an ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is highly effective against NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK and is FDA-approved for patients with NTRK-fusion-positive solid tumors. FDA approval was based on the results of three multicenter, single-arm, clinical trials. In two Phase I clinical trials conducted in a cohort of 119 patients with diverse solid tumors displaying molecular alterations involving NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK, treatment with entrectinib showed clinical responses only in patients that were naive to prior treatment with inhibitors targeting these genes, such as crizotinib, ceritinib or alectinib. Three of three patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged advanced solid tumors responded to entrectinib; durations of response were 2.6 months, 4.6 months and 15.1 months, respectively. Additionally, in two patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, entrectinib demonstrated potent activity as evidenced by a complete intracranial response achieved in a patient with SQSTM1-NTRK1-rearranged lung cancer and a substantial reduction in disease burden in an additional patient with a glioneuronal tumor harboring an NTRK1 rearrangement (PMID: 28183697). At a later evaluation, the overall response rate of the trials was 57.4% (95% CI= 43.2 - 70.8), including four (7.4%) complete responses, with an overall median duration of response of 10.4 months and median overall survival of 20.9 months (95% CI= 14.9 - NR) (Abstract: Demetri et al.

Description: Imatinib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion protein (Philadelphia chromosome; Ph+) that is FDA-approved in Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In a Phase I dose escalation trial of adult patients with Ph+ CML who had failed front-line interferon-alpha therapy, imatinib treatment induced a complete hematologic response in 98% of treated patients, including a major cytogenetic response in 31% of patients (17 of 54) and a complete cytogenetic response in 14% of patients (7 of 54) (PMID: 11287972). In another study of patients with Ph+ CML, imatinib treatment led to a response in 55% of patients in myeloid blast crisis and 70% of patients in lymphoid blast crisis (PMID: 11287973). In a Phase III trial of imatinib versus interferon in combination with low-dose cytarabine in patients with Ph+ CML, higher rates of complete response (95.3% vs. 55.5%, p < 0.001) and progression-free-survival at one year (96.6% vs. 79.9%, p < 0.001) were seen in the imatinib group versus the combination therapy group, respectively (PMID: 12637609).

FDA approval was based on Phase II and Phase III studies of dasatinib in adult patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL in which major hematologic responses were seen in 38%-42% of patients (PMID: 17496201, 20131302). In a Phase II study of first-line dasatinib in adult patients with Ph+ ALL, the median overall survival and median disease-free survival were 30.8 and 21.5 months, respectively, with molecular response to dasatinib correlated to disease-free survival (PMID: 21931113), suggesting that dasatinib also has efficacy in the kinase-inhibitor-naive setting. Approval for pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was based on the Phase II CA180-372 study of 78 pediatric patients with B-cell precursor Ph+ ALL of which there was an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 64.1% (95% CI = 52.4-74.7) (Abstract: Hunger et al.

Description: Nilotinib is a second-generation small molecule inhibitor of BCR-ABL that has increased binding and specificity compared to imatinib and is FDA-approved for the treatment of pediatric or adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP-CML). In a Phase III study of nilotinib versus imatinib in 846 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase, the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher in patients receiving nilotinib at either of two doses versus imatinib (43-44% vs. 22%, p < 0.001), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response (78-80% vs. 65%, p < 0.001) (PMID: 20525993). Importantly, an analysis conducted at the three-year follow-up of patients from this study found significantly fewer ABL1 secondary mutations in patients treated with either dose of nilotinib versus those treated with imatinib, suggesting that nilotinib may prevent the majority of acquired ABL1 secondary resistance mutations that stem from BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition and may prolong treatment responses to BCL-ABL inhibition (PMID: PMID: 23502220). More recent data from the Phase II ENESTop and ENESTfreedom studies have suggested that treatment with nilotinib can be stopped in certain patients who have received nilotinib for at least three years and have achieved specific predetermined criteria, a recommendation which is now included on the FDA label for nilotinib (PMID: 28218239).

FDA approval was based on the results of a Phase III, two-arm, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial (NCT02130557) of bosutinib (n = 246 patients) versus imatinib (n = 241 patients) in 487 eligible adult patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML in which the major molecular and complete cytogenetic responses by month twelve were 47.2% (95% CI: 40.9, 53.4) and 77.2% (95% CI: 72.0, 82.5) in the bosutinib group, respectively, and 36.9% (95% CI: 30.8, 43.0) and 66.4% (95% CI: 60.4, 72.4) in the imatinib group, respectively (PMID: 29091516). In a separate single-arm, open-label, multicenter study (NCT00261846) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bosutinib in 506 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 59.5% (95% CI: 53.3, 65.5) of the 262 evaluable patients with Ph+ CP CML who had prior treatment with imatinib achieved a major cytogenetic response at any time compared to 40.2% (95% CI: 31.0, 49.9) of the 112 patients with Ph+ CP CML who were treated with imatinib plus at least one additional TKI (PMID: 24345751, 26040495). Furthermore, 30.6% (95% CI: 20.2, 42.5) of the 72 patients with AP CML achieved complete hematologic response by week 48 compared to the 16.7% (95% CI: 8.3, 28.5) of 60 patients with BP CML (PMID: 24345751, 26040495). FDA approval of bosutinib for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with CP Ph+ CML that is newly diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to prior therapy was based on the results of the BCHILD trial (NCT04258943).

Bosutinib demonstrated acceptable tolerability in a phase I/II trial (NCT00261846) of 24 patients with Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to prior TKI therapy, and while responses were observed among some patients, analyses of these data were limited by the small number of ALL patients (PMID: 26040495, 24345751). Cell proliferation assays performed with Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL1 demonstrated sensitivity to bosutinib, exhibiting IC50 values <150 nM (PMID: 25132497).

Description: Crizotinib, an inhibitor of ALK, ROS1 and MET tyrosine kinases, is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are ROS1-positive. In a prospective clinical trial of crizotinib in patients with MET fusion-positive lung adenocarcinomas, two of three patients experienced partial responses to treatment with crizotinib (PMID: 29284707). Four other case studies of single patients with MET fusion-positive or kinase-domain-duplication-positive lung cancer documented clinical benefit of crizotinib for these patients, with two of the four patients having a partial response upon crizotinib treatment (PMID: 29527595, 29102694, 29284707)(Abstract: Wang et al. Abstract#e13539, ASCO 2018. http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15_suppl.e13539). In vitro studies of MET fusions expressed in cell lines have shown that these alterations are sensitive to crizotinib as measured by decreased pathway activation and cell viability upon drug treatment (PMID: 29284707).

Description: TK216 is a first-in-class, small molecule inhibitor of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, which is expressed in Ewing sarcoma family tumors. Specifically, TK216 blocks RNA helicase A binding to EWS-FLI1 and impacts alternative splicing in a manner similar to EWS-FLI1 knockdown in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. In vitro and in vivo cell line and orthotopic xenograft studies show that Ewing sarcoma tumors are sensitive to TK216 as measured by decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth upon drug treatment (PMID: 19584866)(Abstract: Selvanathan et al. Abstract# 694, AACR 2017. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/13_Supplement/694). In an open-label phase I/II trial (NCT02657005) of TK216 in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing Sarcoma with any mutational status (n=85), three patients had an extraordinary response (complete response, n=2; partial response, n=1), the disease control rate was 24.7% and the median duration of response was 25 months (95% CI, 1.1-35.2) (PMID: 38954782).

Description: Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor that is FDA-approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair gene. Of patients with BRCA2 (n=128), BRCA1 (n=13) or ATM mutations (n=86), the progression-free survival in the olaparib group was 7.4 months compared to 3.6 months in the placebo group (HR= 0.34; 95% CI=0.25 to 0.47; p<0.001), with a median overall survival of 18.5 months versus 15.1 months (HR=0.64; 95% CI=0.43 to 0.97; p=0.02) and an overall response rate of 33% versus 2% (p=0.02), respectively (PMID: 32343890).

Description: Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have deleterious germline BRCA mutations and have been treated with three or more lines of chemotherapy, or as maintenance therapy for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are having partial or complete responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0·0001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969).

Description: Olaparib is an orally available, small-molecule PARP inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone, based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic. BRCA1 mutations for treatment with olaparib were detected by the FoundationOne CDx, BRACAnalysis CDx or the FoundationOne Liquid CDx. FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound (NCT02987543) trial of olaparib in adult patients with mCRPC who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair gene. 
In the Phase III PROfound (NCT02987543) trial, the BRCA2 (n=128) and BRCA1 (n=13) mutation cohorts treated with olaparib demonstrated a progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.8 months versus 3.0 months in the placebo cohorts (HR= 0.22 [95% CI=0.15-0.32]) (PMID: 32343890).

Description: Niraparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved as maintenance therapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status such as by harboring a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation. FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer.

FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer.

Description: Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have deleterious germline BRCA mutations and have been treated with three or more lines of chemotherapy or as maintenance therapy for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are having partial or complete responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (at 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p=0·0001)(PMID: 24882434). The use of maintenance olaparib versus placebo increased progression-free survival, with a 70% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib (PMID: 30285518, 30345884)(Abstract: Penson et al.

Description: Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene. Of patients with a qualifying alteration in an HRR gene, the progression-free survival in the olaparib group was 5.8 months compared to 3.5 months in the placebo group (HR=0.49; 95% CI=0.38 to 0.63; p<0.001), with a median overall survival of 17.5 months versus 14.3 months (0.67; 95% CI=0.49 to 0.93) and an overall response rate of 22% versus 4%, respectively (PMID: 32343890). However, while the FDA approval includes those with CHEK2 mutations, there is limited clinical data in patients with this biomarker (n=12) (PMID: 32343890).

Description: Neratinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the ERBB2 and EGFR kinases that is FDA-approved for HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. FDA approval was based on results from the Phase III ExteNET trial of neratinib in 2,840 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had been previously treated with trastuzumab in which the two-year disease-free survival rate was 93.9% (95% CI= 92.4-95.2) in the neratinib group versus 91.0% (95% CI= 89.3-92.5) in the placebo group (HR= 0.63, p=0·0017) following one year of drug administration (PMID: 26874901). Five-year follow-up of patients from the ExteNET trial demonstrated that the benefit of neratinib treatment continues past the two-year follow-up, with the five-year invasive disease-free survival being 90.2% (95% CI= 88.3-91.8) in the neratinib group versus 87.7% (95% CI= 85.7-89.4) in the placebo group (PMID: 29146401). In vitro studies in mice have demonstrated that sustained ER inhibition can lead to ERBB2 pathway activation, suggesting a mechanism for neratinib utility in this context (PMID: 30274983). Neratinib with the addition of chemotherapy (capecitabine) has been shown to be active in patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases (PMID: 30860945).

Description: Everolimus is a small molecule inhibitor of mTOR and is FDA-approved for pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who have subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. FDA approval is based on the results of a Phase III clinical trial of everolimus in patients with SEGA associated with TSC in which 35% of patients receiving everolimus (27 of 78 patients) experienced a reduction of at least 50% in the total volume of all targetable SEGAs versus no patients in the placebo group (PMID: 23158522). Patients in the everolimus group responded to the drug irrespective of whether they had a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation, although a higher percentage of patients with TSC1 mutations responded (five of ten patients, 50%) compared to those with TSC2 mutations (sixteen of 55 patients, 29%) (PMID: 23158522). In the Phase II PNOC001 trial of everolimus for 65 patients with progressive/recurrent pediatric low-grade glioma, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation did not correlate with clinical outcomes as the median progression-free survival in active pathways was 11.2 months versus 11.1 months in non active pathways (P = 0.80) (PMID: 37978951).

In another study of four patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, three patients who were treated with crizotinib had a partial response to therapy (PMID: 25971939). A retrospective analysis also identified a patient with lung cancer harboring amplification of a mutant MET allele who had a major partial response to crizotinib (PMID: 26729443). In an open-label, multicenter phase I trial (NCT00585195) of crizotinib in 38 patients with MET-amplified NSCLC, the overall response rate was 28.9% (11/38; 95% CI= 15.4–45.9), with two (5.3%) patients achieving a complete response, nine patients (23.7%) achieving a partial response, eleven (28.9%) having stable disease, and eight (21.1%) having progressive disease, and the overall median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI= 1.9–7.0) (PMID: 33676017).

Description: Talazoparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III EMBRACA trial of talazoparib (1 mg once daily) versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (2:1) in 431 patients with advanced, BRCA1/2 germline-mutated breast cancer in which the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.6 months in the talazoparib group versus 5.6 months in the chemotherapy group (HR= 0.54; 95%CI=0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001) and the objective response rate was 62.6% in the talazoparib group versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy group (p<0.001) (PMID: 30110579). In the Phase II study of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA-mutant breast cancer who had a prior response to platinum agents, the overall response rate was 21-37% (depending on cohort) (PMID: 30563931). In a Phase I study of talazoparib plus carboplatin in patients with and without DNA repair mutations, three patients with somatic BRCA mutations had stable disease beyond four months (Abstract: Dhawan et al. Abstract# 2527, ASCO 2017. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.2527). In the Phase IIb tumor-agnostic JAVELIN BRCA/ATM trial of combination talazoparib and avelumab in 159 patients with BRCA1/2-altered solid tumors, the objective response was observed in 42 patients (26.4%, 95% CI = 19.7%–34.0%) and the median duration of response was 10.9 months (95% CI = 6.2 months to not estimable) (PMID: 36394867). In a retrospective study for 24 patients with BRCA1/2 somatic-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer treated with PARP inhibitors, the median real-world PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI=3.0 to 8.1) and the median real-world overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI=13.8 to NR) while patients harboring BRCA1/2 germline mutations (n=71) demonstrated a median real-world PFS of 6.0 months (95% CI=4.6 to 8.2) and a median real-world overall survival of 21.2 months (95% CI=14.2 to NR) (PMID: 37992259).

Description: Olaparib is an orally available, small molecule PARP inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. There are promising clinical data of response to olaparib in patients with breast cancer harboring somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. 
Olaparib is recommended in the NCCN Breast Cancer Guidelines (V3.2025) under ""Emerging Biomarkers And Novel Therapies For Patients With Stage IV (M1) Disease"" as a category 2B treatment recommendation for patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. NCCN recommendation is based on the results of the Phase II TBCRC 048 (NCT03344965) study of olaparib in 54 patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations or germline/somatic mutations in homologous recombination (HR)-related genes other than BRCA1/2. In the Phase II TBCRC 048 (NCT03344965) study, patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 50% (90% CI=28-72) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months (90% CI=4.4-NA) (PMID: 33119476).
In a retrospective study of 24 patients with BRCA1/2 somatic-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer treated with PARP inhibitors, the median real-world PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI=3.0 to 8.1) and the median real-world overall survival (OS) was 21.2 months (95% CI=13.8 to NR) while patients harboring BRCA1/2 germline mutations (n=71) demonstrated a median real-world PFS of 6.0 months (95% CI=4.6 to 8.2) and a median real-world OS of 21.2 months (95% CI=14.2 to NR) (PMID: 37992259).
In a case report of a patient with triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastasis harboring somatic BRCA1 mutations, the patient was treated with olaparib and demonstrated a remarkable and durable response to treatment (PMID: 35100699).

Description: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an intravenously infused, HER2-targeted antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate that is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase II DESTINY-PanTumor02 (NCT04482309), DESTINY-Lung01 (NCT03505710) and DESTINY-CRC02 (NCT04744831) trials of T-DXd in patients with HER2-positive (defined by IHC 3+) solid tumors. Since the correlation between ERBB2 amplification and HER2 expression has yet to be defined in many solid tumor types and this FDA approval directly specifies HER2-positivity (IHC 3+) as the patient selection criteria, ERBB2 amplification is considered a Level 3A biomarker for this specific indication. In the Phase II DESTINY-PanTumor02 (NCT04482309) trial of T-DXd in 111 patients with HER2-expressing (IHC 3+/2+ by local or central testing) solid tumors, the overall response rate (ORR) was 51.4% (95% CI=41.7-61.0), with a 2.7% complete response (CR) rate and 48.6% partial response (PR) rate, and the median duration of response (DOR) was 19.4 months (range 1.3 months to 27.9+ months) (PMID: 37870536). In the Phase II DESTINY-Lung01 (NCT03505710) trial of T-DXd in seventeen patients with HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+/2+) non-small cell lung cancer, the ORR was 52.9% (95% CI=27.8-77.0), with a 5.9% CR rate and 47.1% PR rate, and the median DOR was 6.9 months (range 4.0 months to 11.7+ months) (PMID: 38547891). In the Phase II DESTINY-CRC02 (NCT04744831) trial of T-DXd in 64 patients with HER2-expressing (IHC 3+, IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) metastatic colorectal cancer, the ORR was 46.9% (95% CI=34.3-59.8), with a 46.9% PR rate, and the median DOR was 5.5 months (range 1.3+ months to 9.7+ months) (PMID: 37286557). In the Phase II HERB trial of T-DXd in 22 patients with HER2-positive (IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) biliary tract cancer, the ORR was 36.4% (95% CI=17.2-59.3), with a 9.1% (n=2) CR rate, 27.3% (n=6) PR rate and 45.5% (n=10) SD rate (PMID: 39102634).

Description: Cisplatin is platinum-based chemotherapy. In a clinical cohort of 48 evaluable patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, ERCC2 mutation was associated with response to therapy (odds ratio, 8.3; 95% CI=1.4-91.4; P = .01) and a statistically significant increase in overall survival (p = 0.03) compared to patients lacking ERCC2 mutations (PMID: 27310333). In a retrospective “extreme responder” analysis of 50 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who were treated with cisplatin, ERCC2 mutations within or near the conserved helicase motif were associated with complete response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (PMID: 25096233). In vitro studies using cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER), the pathway in which ERCC1 and ERCC2 function, showed that defective NER was associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin (PMID: 12208738). A xenograft model using ERCC2-deficient KU19-19 bladder cells demonstrated that loss of ERCC2 results in cisplatin sensitivity, as tumors resulting from ERCC2-deficient cells were cisplatin sensitive while wildtype cells were not (PMID: 29980530).

Description: Trametinib and cobimetinib are small molecule inhibitors of MEK1 and MEK2. Several clinial reports have documented patients with NF1-mutant solid tumors who have responded to treatment with MEK inhibitors. In a case report, a single patient with treatment-refractory neurofibromatosis-associated glioblastoma experienced clinical and radiological benefit from treatment with trametinib (PMID: 26936308). In a retrospective analysis of patients with neurofibromatosis Type I-associated astrocytoma, two of two patients who were treated with trametinib had clinical benefit and partial tumor regression (Abstract: Romo et al. Abstract# e13562, ASCO 2019. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e13562). Other MEK inhibitors, such as selumetinib, have demonstrated efficacy in NF1-associated gliomas, including in a phase II clinical trial in which ten of 25 patients (40% [95% CI:21-61%]) had a sustained partial response to treatment with MEK inhibitors (PMID: 31151904). Additionally, in vitro studies have demonstrated that loss of NF1 results in sensitivity to MEK inhibitors as measured by downstream MAPK pathway signaling and cell proliferation (PMID: 24535670, 24576830).

Description: Erlotinib and gefitinib are first-generation small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Multiple patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET amplification in conjunction with EGFR mutation progressed on erlotinib or gefitinib (PMID: 18093943, 17463250). In two studies of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer that progressed on gefitinib, the presence of MET amplification was acquired in post-progression specimens in four and three samples, respectively (PMID: 17463250, 18093943). The effect of MET on drug sensitivity was confirmed in vitro in EGFR-mutated cell lines, and further analysis indicated that MET drives resistance through ERBB3-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway (PMID: 17463250, 18093943). Larger studies have demonstrated that MET amplification affects response to EGFR TKIs, including osimertinib (PMID: 30676858, 30073261)(Abstract: Michels et al. JCO PO, 2018. https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.18.00210). Notably, the presence of MET amplification in untreated lung cancer has also been observed (PMID: 18093943, 30676858).
